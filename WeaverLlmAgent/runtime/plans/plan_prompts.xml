        <text>Hi Team, I’m Weaver Lee!  Welcome to the potholder design activity.  We will explore weaving in Pique as an opportunity to make ideas from artificial intelligence and machine learning more concrete.</text>
    </prompt> 
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="HOW_TO_QUERY_BOT">
        <text>You can ask me general questions about looms, weaving, ideas for themes, and even matrix math and how it relates to design of weaving drafts.  When you want to ask me a question, start your turn with “Weaver Lee” to get my attention since I get distracted.</text>

	<!-- HINTS & DISCUSSION FOR STAGE 1 -->
       
    <prompt strategy="task" id="ANY_ISSUES">
        <text>Team, do you see any issues with this motif?</text>
     </prompt>
     
    <prompt strategy="task" id="THEMES">
        <text>What themes do you see emerging?</text>
     </prompt>



	<!-- HINTS & DISCUSSION FOR STAGE 2 -->
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="SELECT_MOTIFS">
        <text>Now it is time to select between 2 and 3 motifs for your design. You should start with motifs in csv format from your homework, but you can adjust them as desired. Try to pick a set that fits a theme that can be the theme of your potholder design.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_1">
        <text>Who wants to suggest a motif?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_2">
        <text>Don’t forget to consider the constraints on motifs – they need to be symmetrical and no more than 11 pixels wide altogether.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_3">
        <text>Describe what you think is tricky about making motifs that fit the constraints.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_4">
        <text>Try making a motif that breaks a constraint and then look at what the preview shows. That illustrates what happens when data violates assumptions machine learning models make about the world.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_5">
        <text>What is it about the threading of the loom that requires the motifs to be symmetrical?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_6">
        <text>What is it about the threading of the loom that restricts the width of motifs to be 11 threads wide at most?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_7">
        <text>Don’t forget you’ll need between 2 and 3 motifs that you can describe as fitting together in a theme.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_8">
        <text>Why is the length of a motif potentially unlimited but the width is not?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_PROMPT_9">
        <text>Don’t forget that you need to put each motif in the motif folder and update the motif database.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_2_ENDING_PROMPT">
        <text>Based on your discussion, what is your set of motifs?  What is the theme?</text>
    </prompt>



	<!-- HINTS & DISCUSSION FOR STAGE 3 -->
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="FIT_MOTIFS_INTO_DESIGN">
        <text>It’s time to fit the motifs into a design. Start with each motif on a separate row of a potholder csv. You can leave the other columns with default values to begin with. Each time you change your design, insert it into the database and view the image.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DECIDE_ROW_ARRANGEMENT">
        <text>Decide together how you want the motifs to be arranged across rows.  For example, do you want to alternate every other row?  Or do you have a different pattern in mind?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DECIDE_MOTIF_APPEARANCE">
        <text>Now decide how you want to adjust the appearance of the motif on each row.  For example, you could alternate the orientation of the motifs or alternate between two- color and monochrome.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="MOTIF_ORIENTATION">
        <text>You can easily change the orientation of motifs between rows. Can you see why alternating orientation within rows is harder? This illustrates a challenge of machine learning models to understand the world since what looks similar based on surface form does not always correspond to the same inner workings of the world.</text>
    </prompt>



	<!-- HINTS & DISCUSSION FOR STAGE 4 -->
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="CSV_TO_APPEARANCE">
        <text>As you continue working on your design, let’s think about how the details in the potholder csv affect the visual appearance of the potholder.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_4_PROMPT_1">
        <text>Is it different to set the color mode to monochrome and then invert the image or just invert the 2- color mode image?  Why or why not?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_4_PROMPT_2">
        <text>How would you design a potholder with vertical stripes both in the background color and where the motifs appear?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="STAGE_4_PROMPT_3">
        <text>How would you make a solid colored potholder with no motifs showing?</text>
    </prompt>



	<!-- HINTS & DISCUSSION FOR STAGE 5 -->
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="MOTIF_ASSUMPTION">
        <text>Something about my current setup makes the assumption that you never want the orientation of motifs to vary across columns of the potholder. If I saw a potholder in the world where this was not true, my image of it would enforce the assumption I made. What do you think such a potholder would look like to me based on your experience with motifs?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="WHAT_DO_YOU_THINK">
        <text>I hope I have been helpful.  What do you think about Generative AI?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DO_I_UNDERSTAND">
        <text>How well do you think I understand your design task?  Feel free to test me and see if you are satisfied with my answers.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="ASK_ME">
        <text>Ask me a hard question about your design and see if I can answer it properly.  Then tell me what you think my answer reveals about my capabilities.</text>
    </prompt>



	<!-- HINTS & DISCUSSION FOR STAGE 6 -->
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="KEEP_WORKING">
