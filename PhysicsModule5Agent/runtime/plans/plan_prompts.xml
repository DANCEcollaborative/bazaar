    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A1">
        <text>You have a circuit consisting of a variety of elements including a 9-V battery (measured as 9 V when you put a voltmeter across it without an external circuit), a switch, and several resistors. You measure current through different circuit elements and the potential difference across them (each element has corresponding voltmeter and ammeter numbers). Click on "Sharing Space" at the left to see the results.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A2">
        <text>Draw a picture of the circuit for which these measurements could have been taken, and upload its URL into the Sharing Space.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A3">
        <text>Did you include voltmeters and ammeters in your circuit? If not, where would they be added?</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A4">
        <text>Which circuit elements are in series and which are in parallel?</text>

        <text>A figure of a "chair" is shown in the Sharing Space. The chair is made of 11 identical metal rods, each rod having a resistance of 10 Ω  The legs of the chair are connected to a 9-V battery of negligible internal resistance with wires that have negligible resistance.|Do you all understand the diagram?</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B2">
        <text>Compare the potential differences between different pairs of connected nodes that are labeled with the letters. Are there any pairs of connected nodes for which the potential difference is zero? Explain.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B3">
        <text>Your friend says: “When the potential difference between two nodes is zero, removing the wire between those two nodes from the circuit will not cause any changes in the currents in the remaining circuit.” Are they correct?</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B4">
        <text>How can you convince others that they are correct?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B5">
        <text>Apply the rule invented by your friend to reduce the initial circuit by removing all rods across which the potential difference is zero. Draw an equivalent “flat” circuit diagram of the reduced circuit, and upload its URL into the Sharing Space.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B6">
