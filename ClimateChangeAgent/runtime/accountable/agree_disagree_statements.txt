renewable energy is cheaper in the long run
renewable energy resources will never run out
renewable energy costs more initially
renewable energy costs less after installation
fossil fuels will get more expensive over time
fossil fuels will eventually run out
electric cars will become less expensive
electric cars will become cheaper 
electric cars are cheaper to maintain
jobs lost in fossil fuel industries will be replaced by jobs in renewable energy
fossil fuel usage is a major cause of climate change
humans are a big cause of climate change
without human effects, temperature would remain about the same
with natural forces only, temperature would remain about the same
carbon dioxide is increasing much more rapidly than before
carbon dioxide causes temperatures to rise
fossil fuels create carbon dioxide 
carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels are increasing
the mayor is wrong
the mayor is short-sighted
temperature change plays a role in climate change
carbon dioxide plays a role in climate change
fossil fuels play a role in climate change
temperature change, carbon dioxide, and fossil fuels all play a role in climate change
fossil fuels are less expensive
renewable energy is more expensive
fossil fuels are cheaper
renewable energy is cheaper
renewable energy is unreliable
fossil fuels are more reliable
