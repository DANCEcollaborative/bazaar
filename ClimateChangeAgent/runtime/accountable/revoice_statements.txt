renewable energy is cheaper in the long run because the energy itself is free
renewable energy resources will never run out because it comes from renewable sources
renewable energy costs more initially because the infrastucture is new
renewable energy costs less after installation because the energy itself is free
fossil fuels will get more expensive over time as they become more scarce
fossil fuels will eventually run out because we use them much faster than they are created
electric cars will become less expensive as the autoindustry switches to making electric cars
electric cars are cheaper to maintain because they have fewer moving parts
jobs lost in fossil fuel industries will be replaced by jobs in renewable energy because there is lots of infrastructure work to do
fossil fuel usage is a major cause of climate change because fossil fuels create carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide raises the earth's temperature
humans are a big cause of climate change as can be clearly seen in graph
humans are a big cause of climate change because humans burn fossil fuels
the graph shows us that without human effects temperature would remain about the same
the graph shows us that with natural forces only temperature would remain about the same
carbon dioxide is increasing much more rapidly than before, as shown in the graph
the graph shows that carbon dioxide causes temperatures to rise
burning fossil fuels creates carbon dioxide 
carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels are increasing 
fossil fuels are more reliable because they don't depend on the weather
