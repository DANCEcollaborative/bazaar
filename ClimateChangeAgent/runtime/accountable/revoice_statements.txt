humans are a major cause of climate change as can be seen in the graph
people are a major cause of climate change because people burn fossil fuels
the graph shows that without human effects temperature would remain about the same
the graph shows that with only natural forces temperature would remain about the same
carbon dioxide is increasing much more rapidly than before, as shown in the graph
the table shows that carbon dioxide causes temperatures to rise
burning fossil fuels creates carbon dioxide 
carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels are increasing 
renewable energy is cheaper in the long run because the energy itself is free
renewable energy resources will never run out because it comes from renewable sources
renewable energy costs more initially because the infrastucture is new
renewable energy costs less after installation because the energy itself is free
fossil fuels will get more expensive over time as they become more scarce
fossil fuels will run out
fossil fuels are a major cause of climate change because they create carbon dioxide, and carbon dioxide raises the earth's temperature
fossil fuels are more reliable because they don't depend on the weather 
if the town stops using fossil fuels, it will lose jobs
the mayor wants to keep bills and taxes low 
saving money is the mayor's priority
electric cars will become less expensive as the auto industry switches to making electric cars
electric cars are cheaper to maintain because they have fewer moving parts
jobs lost in fossil fuel industries will be replaced by jobs in renewable energy because there is lots of infrastructure to create
