        <text> 
               I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team. |Remember that the answers you agree on will be considered as part of the team score.

                Let's start with the experiment you saw in class earlier - - starch inside the dialysis tubing, iodine solution outside.

        <text> 
                &lt;&lt; On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of that lab setup. How did the inside and outside colors change over time?

    <prompt strategy="task" id="CONDITION_A_EXPLAIN">
        <text> 
                Explain what the changes in color tell you about the movement of starch and iodine molecules, and about the membrane.

                Let's do another set of experiments. We'll use the same dialysis tubing membrane, but with pure water on the outside and a glucose solution on the inside.

        <text> 
                We'll use the tube weight as an indicator for water movement. |  We'll also use *glucose test strips* to detect glucose in the both environments.
