               I won't tell you if you're right or wrong, but I'll give feedback as you discuss things as a team. |||Remember that the answers you agree on will be considered as part of the team score.

                Let's start with the experiment you saw in class earlier - - starch inside the dialysis tubing, iodine solution outside.

        <text> 
                &lt;&lt; On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of that lab setup. How did the inside and outside colors change over time?

    <prompt strategy="task" id="CONDITION_A_EXPLAIN">
        <text> 
                Explain what the changes in color tell you about the movement of starch and iodine molecules, and about the membrane.
