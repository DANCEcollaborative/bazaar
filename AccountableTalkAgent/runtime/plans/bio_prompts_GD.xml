                Let's start with the experiment you saw in class earlier - - starch inside the dialysis tubing, iodine solution outside.

        <text> 
                &lt;&lt; On the whiteboard, you can see a picture of that lab setup. How did the inside and outside colors change over time?

                Explain what the changes in color tell you about the movement of starch and iodine molecules, and about the membrane.

                There might be more going on, as well.|||On the whiteboard, here's the weight of the dialysis tube at each point in time.
