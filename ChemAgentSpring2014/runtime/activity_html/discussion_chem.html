		<h2>General Introduction</h2>
		<p>Each member of your group has received some training materials on the intermolecular forces that hold liquids together and 
		   influence a liquid's boiling point.  In particular, one of you has learned about the forces at work in liquids consisting of 
		   non-polar molecules, one of you learned about liquids composed of polar molecules, and one of you learned about ionic liquids.</p>
		<p>We'll be asking you some questions that will give you an opportunity to teach the other members of your group about the 
		   things you've read about.  In addition, we'll ask you some questions that will require your collective expertise.  Make sure you 
		   discuss things with the other members of your group - because by doing so, you'll be able produce more accurate answers to the questions 
		   and you'll all learn more.</p>

		<h2>Predicting Boiling Points</h2>
		<p>Now that you've looked at some data that demonstrate the various intermolecular forces and their effects on a substance's boiling point, 
		   we're going to look at some incomplete data sets to get a little practice.  Here you'll be given the names and chemical 
		   formulae of three substances but boiling points for only two of them.  Your job will be to decide where the third substance falls in the 
		   series.  Is its boiling point higher than that of the other two substances?  Is it in between them, or is it lower than both of them?  
		   You should discuss with your group which of the factors you discussed earlier are relevant for the given substances and 
		   how those factors influence a substance's boiling point.  Make sure that everyone agrees on one answer.</p>
		<img class="chem_image"  src="http://collective2.chem.cmu.edu/chem105/intermolecular/images/predictboiling_1_diagram_700.png"/>   
		<p>Once you've agreed on an answer, you will be given some additional data about the substances which may or may not help you with your task.  
		   You will need to determine whether that data is relevant to the given substances and, if so, whether it confirms or contradicts your initial 
		   answer.  Again, make sure your group comes to a consensus on whether your initial answer is correct or not.  If you think your group's initial 
		   answer was wrong, try to agree on which answer is correct.</p>
		<p>After you either have picked a new answer or stuck with your original answer, you'll be given the missing boiling point data and possibly
   		   some additional, pertinent data, along with an explanation.  Whether you got the answer right or not, you should look at the data and explanation 
		   to make sure you understand how to reason about the data.  Ok, let's get started!</p>

		<p>Ok, here's the moment of truth!  It turns out that the boiling point of stannane is 221 &#176;K, giving it a higher boiling point than both 
		   silane and germane.  Because these are non-polar molecules, the only intermolecular force at work is the dispersion force.  
		   As the molecule at the center of the tetrahedron gets bigger (silane &#8594;  germane &#8594;  stannane), so does the molecule's van der 
		   Waals area.  This means that there is more area over which molecules can experience attractive interactions with other molecules. 
		   The increased attraction between molecules results in an elevated boiling point.</p>
		<p>Unfortunately, the van der Waals area of germane was not available, so the van der Waals areas of these molecules won't be provided
  		   here.  However, it turns out that the molar mass of molecules often serves as a helpful proxy for van der Waals area.  In general, 
		   and certainly within classes of similar molecules, the van der Waals area goes up monotonically with molar mass.</p>

		<p>It turns out that isobutanol has a boiling point of 380.81 &#176;K, which puts it in between butanol and tert-butanol.

		<p>The boiling point of diethyl ether is 307.58 &#176;K, which puts it in between butanol and methyl ethyl ether.  To understand
  		   how to reason about this data set, it makes sense to divide it into two comparisons: comparing diethyl ether with methyl 
		   ethyl ether and comparing diethyl ether with butanol.</p>
		<p>Diethyl ether has a slightly lower dipole moment than methyl ethyl ether, which you might expect would lead to diethyl 
		   ether having a lower boiling point than methyl ethyl ether.  However, diethyl ether's larger van der Waals area dominates the 
		   dipole consideration and leads to a higher boiling point.  Even without the van der Waals area data, the fact that the two 
		   molecules have a similar dipole moment but diethyl ether has an additional carbon and 2 hydrogens should lead you to guess 
		   that diethyl ether has the higher boiling point.</p>
		<p>In comparing diethyl ether and butanol, the first thing to notice is that they have the same chemical formula.  As a 
		   consequence, we can expect their van der Waals areas and dispersion forces to be comparable.  Once you see the additional 
		   data, the fact that butanol has both a larger dipole and greater van der Waals area should make it obvious that its boiling 
		   point is higher.  In this case, more than 80 &#176;K higher.</p>

		<p>Everything you have learned so far should have prompted you to say that propanol has a boiling point between those of methyl

		   points of both methyl vinyl ether and methyl ethyl ketone.  This is true despite the fact that both its dipole moment and van 
		   der Waals area fall in between those of the other two molecules.  So, what is going on?</p>
		<p>Before we get into a formal explanation of this, let's take a look at some more data, just to illustrate that the behavior of

		   an increase in dipole moment from about 1 Debye to nearly 3 Debye results in an a boiling point elevation of 40-50 &#176;K.

		<p>In contrast, for molecules with the formula C<font size="-2"><sub>n</sub></font>H<font size="-2"><sub>2(n+1)</sub></font>O, the

		<p>It turns out that hydrogen bonding is a factor here.  We haven't discussed hydrogen bonding yet, so let's take a look at it.  </p>
		<p>Hydrogen bonding comes about when a molecule contains a X-H bond where X is O, F, or N.  These highly electronegative
   		   atoms pull on the hydrogen's electron such that the hydrogen atom ends up with a partial positive charge.  
		   This positive charge, typically denoted &#948;+, is then attracted to lone pairs of electrons belonging to atoms on 
		   different molecules (or even different parts of the same molecule).</p>
		<p>Hydrogen bonds can be quite strong (about 1/10th the strength of a covalent bond) and they account for some boiling point
  		   behavior that cannot be explained via dispersion or dipole-dipole interactions, like the high boiling point of water.</p>

	    <p>If you look at the molecules in the table above, you can observe that only with propanol, do we have the necessary conditions for hydrogen bonding: 
		   an O-H bond.  It is this bond and the hydrogen bonding that it enables that is responsible for propanol's unexpectedly high boiling point.</p>
		<p>Don't forget, all these forces are cumulative.  So, molecules that hydrogen bond with one another also experience dispersion forces and 
		   dipole-dipole forces.  Recall question 1 about butanol and its branched isomers.  The branched isomers had lower boiling points than the 
		   non-branched isomer.  As discussed, this is because branching caused a reduction in dispersion interactions between molecules.  
		   So, even though butanol, like propanol, has hydrogen bonding, part of its boiling point behavior still comes from dispersion forces 
		   and if those dispersion forces are reduced, so is its boiling point.  </p>

	    <p>Well, how did you do?</p>
	    <p>The one consistent trend across all the comparisons is that the van der Waals area increases 
	       with each fluorine added.  This should have been expected since hydrogen is a small atom.  </p>
		<p>Hopefully, you also recognized the dipole moment trend.  Since fluorine has a high electronegativity, 
		   when one fluorine is substituted for one hydrogen, you should expect the dipole moment to go up.  
		   When you substitute another fluorine for another hydrogen and you perform the vector sum, you will 
		   find that the dipole moment should go up again.  When you add a substitute in a third fluorine, 
		   the bond dipoles start to cancel out and the dipole moment goes down.  Finally, it should have 
		   been clear that when you had four fluorines, the bond dipoles completely cancel and the overall 
		   dipole moment is zero.</p>
		<p>The difficulty here is that the van der Waals area rises with each additional fluorine, 
		   while the dipole moment initially increases and then decreases.  Given that both the dipole 
		   moment and the van der Waals area increase with the substitution of the first two fluorines, 
		   it should have been clear that the boiling point would increase.  However, when you substitute 
		   in a third fluorine and the dipole moment goes down, what happens to the boiling point?  Does the 
		   effect of the van der Waals area win and increase the boiling point or does the effect of the 
		   dipole moment dominate and result in a reduced boiling point?  In this case, the dipole moment 
		   wins and we see a reduction in boiling point with each of the last two fluorines added.  However, 
		   it&#146;s worth noting that the boiling point of tetrafluoromethane is higher than that of methane 
		   due to the increase in van der Waals area.</p>

	<div class="chem_box chem_text">	
	    <p>Looking at the van der Waals area data, we see that each chlorine substituted into the 
	       molecule increases the van der Waals area, except for the last one, which results in a small 
	       decrease.  This decrease is probably because in trichloromethane, the relatively large chlorine
	       atoms (at least large in relation to hydrogen) spread out as much as they can to reduce repulsion 
	       between them.  However, when the fourth chlorine is added, the atoms are forced back into the 
	       tetrahedral structure.</p>
	    <p>In the dipole data, we see more evidence of chlorines spreading out.  The fact that the dipole
	       moment decreases from chloromethane to dichloromethane indicates that the angle between the 
	       chlorines is larger than 109.47 degrees, which is expected for tetrahedral molecules.  So, you 
	       might not have expected the dipole moment to decrease from chloromethane to dichloromethane but 
	       hopefully you expected the rest of the dipole moment behavior based on the fluoromethane trends.</p>

</div>
	
<div  id="final_b_explain">
	<div class="chem_box chem_text">
		<p>Now that we've explained the van der Waals area and dipole moment trends, let's look 
		   at the boiling point.  In the case of the fluoromethanes, we saw the boiling point track with the 
		   dipole moment.  What happens here?  Well, except for the rise in boiling point from 
		   trichloromethane to tetrachloromethane, the boiling point tracks well with the van der Waals area.  
		   Why should dipole moment dominate for the fluoromethanes but not the chloromethanes? 
		   Well, you can see that, on average, the van der Waals area of the chloromethanes is much larger 
		   than that of the fluoromethanes.  This means that the dispersion forces will be larger.  
		   Evidently, in the case of the chloromethanes, the dispersion forces are large enough that 
		   they outweigh the dipole-dipole interactions.</p>
		<p>Before we move on to the bromomethanes, you may still be wondering how the boiling point of 
		   tetrachloromethane can be higher than that of trichloromethane despite the fact that both 
		   its van der Waals area and dipole moment are lower.  From the data presented in Table 4, 
		   there is no good explanation.  However, one possible explanation is that the added 
		   chlorine increases the polarizability of the molecule.</p>
		<p>If you look at the van der Waals volume of trichloromethane and tetrachloromethane, they are 
		   43.5 cm<font size="-2"><sup>3</sup></font>/mol and 52.3 cm<font size="-2"><sup>3</sup></font>/mol,
		   respectively.  Since polarizability tracks with van der Waals volume, it seems reasonable, 
		   in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that the added chlorine increases 
		   the polarizability of tetrachloromethane.  While no polarizability data is available, 
		   it seems reasonable to assume that the increased polarizability of tetrachloromethane 
		   is sufficiently large so as to offset the reduction in van der Waals area and lead 
		   to an increase in dispersion forces.  This increase in dispersion forces is then
		   responsible for the increase in boiling point in spite of the reduction in van der Waals area.</p>
