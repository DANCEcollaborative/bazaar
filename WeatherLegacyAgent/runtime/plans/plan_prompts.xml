    	<text>The agent is listening for several kinds of triggers to start supporting students. |For example, David cares a lot about "Accountable Talk" style facilitation these days. | The provided AT example is configured for college chemistry. If you've turned on any of the revoice, agree, say_more, or explain conditions, try saying something like "boiling point increases with dipole moment."|(and then wait a little while, this behavior waits for other students to follow up before offering support.)</text>
