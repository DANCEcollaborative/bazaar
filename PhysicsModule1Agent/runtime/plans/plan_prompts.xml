        <text>You will need paper and a pen or pencil (or a good drawing program on your computer) to practice drawing ray diagrams in this activity. A ruler or straight edge will also be helpful.

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A2">
        <text>Examine the image of a swimming pool in the Activity Plan tab. It shows a “1 FEET DEEP” sign on the side of a children’s pool. Discuss the following questions:|Why do some of the letters in “FEET DEEP” look different even though they are all painted the same size?|Why do you see multiple letters, even though each word is painted once?|Take five minutes to discuss possible explanations.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A3">
        <text>Now based on your discussion, use ray diagrams to account for all the effects in this image. Take up to five minutes for each of you to draw your own ray diagrams on paper or using a drawing program on your computer. I encourage you to use a ruler or straight edge. If feasible, if you can create a public URL for your image, you may share your images for discussion by pasting the URL for your images into the Sharing Space tab at the left.|Type ‘ready’ when you have drawn your diagram.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A4">
        <text>I will now share one of my ray diagrams with you in the Sharing Space tab at the left. Which feature does this diagram correspond to, and how does it account for this feature? What does the black vertical arrow represent?</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A4a">
        <text>Discuss for up to 3 minutes, or type “ready” when you all agree.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A6">
        <text>I will share another ray diagram in the Sharing Space tab. Take up to 4 minutes to discuss my diagram and to compare and contrast my diagram to yours.

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A7">
        <text>I will now share my last ray diagram with you in the Sharing Space. Take up to 4 minutes to discuss my diagram and to compare and contrast my diagram to yours.

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B2">
        <text>Your task is to determine which side of the foil (the flat or prism side) was facing the flashlight in experiment (a) and which in experiment (b). Discuss for up to ten minutes. Use ray diagrams and calculations to justify your answer.|If feasible, if you can create a public URL for your image, you may share your image by pasting the URL for your images into the Sharing Space for discussion. Remember it will help your learning if you can each draw your own diagram, even if you cannot share it now.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B3">
        <text>Check that you agree on the incident angles from air into the foil, and from the foil back into the air, for case (a) and case (b).</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B7">
        <text>We will move on now to the last question. How will the performance of the foil change if you cover the prism side of the foil with a layer of water (thick enough to fill and flatten the grooves)? Take five minutes to discuss.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B8">
        <text>If you don’t remember the index of refraction of water, remember you can look it up online.</text>
