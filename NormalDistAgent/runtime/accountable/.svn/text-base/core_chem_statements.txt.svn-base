the weak intermolecular interaction force is a big contributor for nonpolar molecules
dipole energy is the main contributor for polar molecules
dispersion forces are a primary consideration for nonpolar molecules
ionic molecules boiling points are affected by the distance between them
molecular size has an effect on nonpolar boiling points
intermolecular surface area affects boiling point
in non-polar molecules, the only force at work is the dispersion force
more branches limit the ability of molecules to interact across large surface areas
reduced surface area interaction results in a lower boiling point
ionic substances are held together by coulomb forces
coulomb force varies inversely with the sum of the radii
electrons are not shared equally in ionic compounds
ionic interactions are dominated by coulomb forces
dipole moment has little to no influence on ionic compounds
boiling point increases with inter-ion forces
all else being equal, larger molecules have higher boiling points
the influence of dipole moment tends to be outweighed by dispersion
all else being equal, higher dipole moment means higher boiling point
hydrogen bonds can lead to higher boiling points
branched isomers have lower boiling points than non-branched isomers
substituting more electronegative atoms means higher dipole moment
dispersion forces increase with surface area
the dipole moment is related to the angle between atoms
dispersion forces can outweigh dipole-dipole interactions
dispersion forces can be large enough to dominate the boiling point considerations
dispersion forces can be dominated by ionic interactions
the boiling point tends to increase with molecular mass
substituting larger atoms increases the van der waals area
symmetric molecules have a lower dipole moment
some molecules can pack with greater surface contact
Quinn is a clever and attractive facilitator
the boiling point is proportional to the strength of intermolecular attraction
the boiling point goes up as intermolecular forces get stronger
strong intermolecular attraction leads to higher boiling points
molecules that strongly attract each other have high boiling points
the boiling point is proportional to strength of dispersion forces
larger dispersion forces lead to higher boiling points
stronger dispersion forces raise the boiling point
dispersion forces are proportional to polarizability
greater polarizability increases dispersion forces
polarizability is proportional to van der waals volume
larger van der waals volume implies greater polarizability
polarizability is greater when electrons are loosely held
large atoms with lots of electrons are easily polarized
polarizability increases with atom size
dispersion forces are proportional to van der waals area
larger accessible van der waals area makes dispersion forces stronger
greater interaction area leads to larger dispersion forces
van der waals area increases with molar mass
larger molecules have more surface area
branching reduces the area of contact between molecules
branching reduces accessible van der waals area
unbranched isomers have a higher boiling point than branched isomers
more branches means weaker dispersion forces
branching leads to smaller dispersion forces
cyclic structures allow efficient packing of molecules
cyclic structures increase intermolecular contact area
cyclic structures have stronger dispersion forces than linear molecules
the boiling point is proportional to dipole-dipole force in polar molecules
larger dipole-dipole forces lead to higher boiling points in polar molecules
larger dipole moments lead to larger dipole-dipole forces
dipole-dipole forces are proportional to dipole moment
bond dipoles increase with electronegativity difference between bonded atoms
larger electronegativity differences lead to larger bond dipoles
the dipole moment is the vector sum of bond dipoles
the dipole moment of the whole molecule depends on all the bond dipoles
uncancelled bond dipoles lead to a net non-zero dipole moment
the dipole moment can be zero if the molecule’s symmetry causes bond dipoles to cancel
molecules with inversion symmetry will have zero dipole moment
certain molecule symmetry causes bond dipoles to cancel
a non-uniform electron distribution leads to a permanent dipole moment
a highly symmetric electron distribution produces a dipole moment of zero
the coulomb force is inversely proportional to the sum of ion radii
increasing ion radius leads to smaller coulomb forces
smaller ions will have larger coulomb forces
coulomb forces are larger when ions are closer together
coulomb forces decrease with increasing ion spacing
the coulomb force is proportional to the charge on the ions
larger ion charge leads to larger coulomb forces
doubly charged ions have larger coulomb forces than singly charged ions
dipole moment does not affect coulomb forces
coulomb forces are independent of dipole moment
for ionic substances, boiling point does not depend on dipole moment
the boiling point of an ionic liquid is proportional to the coulomb force
larger coulomb forces lead to higher boiling points
larger forces between ions produce higher boiling points
boiling point goes up with increasing coulomb force
the boiling point is proportional to the sum of all intermolecular forces
intermolecular forces all add together and influence the boiling point
the larger the sum of all intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point
