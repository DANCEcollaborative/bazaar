        <text>Hi, I'm [AGENT NAME]. Throughout this activity, I will be facilitating your discussion about this Normal Distribution lab.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="INTRO">
        <text>Let's start by introducing yourselves. Give your name and favorite topic in this course, so far.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4_BACKGROUND">
        <text>First, we will look at the two sets of data that you have prepared in Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the assignment. Select the SPREADSHEET tab to the left of the discussion board. Notice that this spreadsheet has three sheet tabs at the bottom named "Combined", "Team A", and "Team B". One person from each team will select their team's tab (tab "Team A' or tab "Team B), remove the data in Column A, then paste your data in Column A. Now you can compare the results. When both teams have finished copying their data, every team member must select the "I'm Ready" button in the DISCUSSION board to continue.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4a">
        <text>You will be prompted to answer 9 questions. Question 1: Compare and contrast the statistics and histogram from the two teams. Each person should type into the DISCUSSION board either 1 similarity or 1 difference or both.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4b">
        <text>We are now moving to Part 4 in the instructions which is about analyzing the combined data (n=60 size data set). Now select the "Combined" tab.  Identify one person to clear out the data in Column A.  Next, copy the data from Column A in both Team A and Team B so that all data is now in Column A of the "Combined" tab. When finished, every team member must select the "I'm Ready" button in the DISCUSSION board to continue.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4b1">
        <text>Question 2: Open the "Combined" tab. Discuss the symmetry of the histogram including comparisons of the mean and the median. What does this say about people’s finger length?</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4b2">
        <text>Question 3: Discuss the symmetry of the histogram including comparisons of the mean and the median. What does this say about people’s finger length?</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4c">
        <text>Question 4: How did the standard deviations change when you combined the data?  Why do you think this might be?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4d">
        <text>Question 5: Find and post the interval that contains the pinkie length within two standard deviations of your mean. If all teammates do not agree on the answer, discuss it and convince each other you are correct.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4e">
        <text>Question 6: What percent of the data are within two standard deviations of the mean?  Round to two decimal places. If all teammates do not agree on the answer, discuss it and try to convince your partners that you are correct.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4f">
        <text>Question 7: According to the Normal distribution, what percent of the data would you expect to be within two standard deviations of the mean? Why?</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4g">
        <text>Question 8: Discuss whether the combined data that you collected gives a close approximation to the Normal distribution.  Explain why or why not. Each person should contribute to the discussion.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4h">
        <text>Question 9: State your recommendations to the client based on your results.  Be sure to include references to the Normal distribution.</text>
    </prompt>


    <prompt strategy="task" id="FINISH">
        <text>Now this activity has come to an end. Thanks for a great chat!</text>
