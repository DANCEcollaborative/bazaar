        <text>You can click on the Collaborate menu on the top right and click on each participant's name to see which files they currently have open.

    </prompt>
        
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_ROLE_INTRO" intention="instr5">
        <text>We will rotate roles every time a new test case passes. All of you will get to be the driver over the course of the exercise. Recall that the , with the support of the researcher and the rest of the group, decides the direction that the driver writes in code. The project manager is responsible for making sure the entire group is on track. They can refer to the 'project_manager_dashboard.txt' file for suggestions and nudge group members to adequately perform their roles and call on them for support when necessary.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_MATCH_1">
        <text>Even though you are doing the activity by yourself, try to follow the responsibilities associated with the roles -- i.e. try to first brainstorm for ideas, then analyze their pros and cons to choose one, and then implement it. If someone joins later, have them assume one of the missing roles and assist until you pass a test case.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_MATCH_2">
        <text>The new roles are -
[ROLE1] - [NAME1]
[ROLE2] - [NAME2]
Recall that the navigator brainstorms ideas and decides on one which the driver then implements.

        <text>The new roles are -
[ROLE1] - [NAME1]
[ROLE2] - [NAME2]
[ROLE3] - [NAME3]
Since we are missing a member, the project manager will monitor the group's progress towards the milestones and refer to resources like the primer as necessary. If someone joins later, have them assume one of the missing roles and assist until you pass a test case.

     <text>Now, before we move on to the next task, let's learn from this task by discussing as a group.|||Because we want you to learn from the activity, you can make up some of your score by participating in this discussion in case you don't get a full score from the activity.</text>

     <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_LO1_SOLUTION">
     <text>Here's a hint in case you are stuck ...|||Did you explore the use of the list methods max() and min() to separately find the maximum and minimum in the list?</text>
     </prompt>
     
     <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_LO1_REFLECTION">
     <text>We'll have the project manager lead the discussion. Take turns to talk about challenges you faced while playing your role. How could you have played it better? We'll move on once you have had some time to discuss.</text>

     <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_LO2_SOLUTION">
     <text>Here's a hint in case you are stuck ...|||Similar to Task 1, ensure that the selling price is greater than the buying price. Try tracking the min price and max profit so far while looping through the list.</text>

     <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_LO2_REFLECTION">
     <text>Project manager-led discussion time now. Take turns to answer the following question. What do you think you are learning in each of the roles? We'll move on once you have had some time to discuss.</text>

     <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_LO4_SOLUTION">
     <text>Here's a hint in case you are stuck ...|||The two transactions may be decomposed into four actions: "buying transaction #1","selling transaction #1","buying transaction #2" and "selling transaction #2". Over the iterations, consider calculating four variables which correspond to the costs or the profits of each action respectively in the two transactions. Use min() and max() to update these four variables iteratively.</text>

     <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_LO4_REFLECTION">
     <text>Final discussion time led by the project manager. Take turns to talk about how each group member playing a role can utilize the other role's to the group's benefit. We'll move on once you have had some time to discuss.</text>
