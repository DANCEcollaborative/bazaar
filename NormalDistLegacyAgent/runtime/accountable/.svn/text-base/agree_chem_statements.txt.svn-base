the weak intermolecular interaction force is a big contributor for nonpolar molecules
dipole energy is the main contributor for polar molecules
dispersion forces are a primary consideration for nonpolar molecules
ionic molecules boiling points are affected by the distance between them
molecular size has an effect on nonpolar boiling points
intermolecular surface area affects boiling point
in non-polar molecules, the only force at work is the dispersion force
more branches limit the ability of molecules to interact across large surface areas
reduced surface area interaction results in a lower boiling point
ionic substances are held together by coulomb forces
coulomb force varies inversely with the sum of the radii
electrons are not shared equally in ionic compounds
ionic interactions are dominated by coulomb forces
dipole moment has little to no influence on ionic compounds
boiling point increases with inter-ion forces
all else being equal, larger molecules have higher boiling points
the influence of dipole moment tends to be outweighed by dispersion
all else being equal, higher dipole moment means higher boiling point
hydrogen bonds can lead to higher boiling points
branched isomers have lower boiling points than non-branched isomers
substituting more electronegative atoms means higher dipole moment
dispersion forces increase with surface area
the dipole moment is related to the angle between atoms
dispersion forces can outweigh dipole-dipole interactions
dispersion forces can be large enough to dominate the boiling point considerations
dispersion forces can be dominated by ionic interactions
the boiling point tends to increase with molecular mass
substituting larger atoms increases the van der waals area
symmetric molecules have a lower dipole moment
some molecules can pack with greater surface contact
Quinn is a clever and attractive facilitator
the boiling point is proportional to the strength of intermolecular attraction
the boiling point goes up as intermolecular forces get stronger
strong intermolecular attraction leads to higher boiling points
molecules that strongly attract each other have high boiling points
the boiling point is proportional to strength of dispersion forces
larger dispersion forces lead to higher boiling points
stronger dispersion forces raise the boiling point
dispersion forces are proportional to polarizability
greater polarizability increases dispersion forces
polarizability is proportional to van der waals volume
larger van der waals volume implies greater polarizability
polarizability is greater when electrons are loosely held
large atoms with lots of electrons are easily polarized
polarizability increases with atom size
dispersion forces are proportional to van der waals area
larger accessible van der waals area makes dispersion forces stronger
greater interaction area leads to larger dispersion forces
van der waals area increases with molar mass
larger molecules have more surface area
branching reduces the area of contact between molecules
branching reduces accessible van der waals area
unbranched isomers have a higher boiling point than branched isomers
more branches means weaker dispersion forces
branching leads to smaller dispersion forces
cyclic structures allow efficient packing of molecules
cyclic structures increase intermolecular contact area
cyclic structures have stronger dispersion forces than linear molecules
the boiling point is proportional to dipole-dipole force in polar molecules
larger dipole-dipole forces lead to higher boiling points in polar molecules
larger dipole moments lead to larger dipole-dipole forces
dipole-dipole forces are proportional to dipole moment
bond dipoles increase with electronegativity difference between bonded atoms
larger electronegativity differences lead to larger bond dipoles
the dipole moment is the vector sum of bond dipoles
the dipole moment of the whole molecule depends on all the bond dipoles
uncancelled bond dipoles lead to a net non-zero dipole moment
the dipole moment can be zero if the moleculeÕs symmetry causes bond dipoles to cancel
molecules with inversion symmetry will have zero dipole moment
certain molecule symmetry causes bond dipoles to cancel
a non-uniform electron distribution leads to a permanent dipole moment
a highly symmetric electron distribution produces a dipole moment of zero
the coulomb force is inversely proportional to the sum of ion radii
increasing ion radius leads to smaller coulomb forces
smaller ions will have larger coulomb forces
coulomb forces are larger when ions are closer together
coulomb forces decrease with increasing ion spacing
the coulomb force is proportional to the charge on the ions
larger ion charge leads to larger coulomb forces
doubly charged ions have larger coulomb forces than singly charged ions
dipole moment does not affect coulomb forces
coulomb forces are independent of dipole moment
for ionic substances, boiling point does not depend on dipole moment
the boiling point of an ionic liquid is proportional to the coulomb force
larger coulomb forces lead to higher boiling points
larger forces between ions produce higher boiling points
boiling point goes up with increasing coulomb force
the boiling point is proportional to the sum of all intermolecular forces
intermolecular forces all add together and influence the boiling point
the larger the sum of all intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point
with alkanes, branching them reduces their van der waals forces
becuase more electrons -> more electron variation -> more van der waals forces
and to generalize the branching thing, if the molecules sort of 'compact', ie a cyclic molecule, they will also have a stronger dispersion force (which is why branching doesn't work well, because you can't compact the molecules)
don't the unbranched molecules have higher boiling point than the branched ones, suggesting that the unbranched molecules have stronger van der waals force
Yeah. branching decreases the vanderwaals forces, decreasing the boiling point. This is because they 'compact' well, letting them have a higher sort of surface area between them
i guess more mass causes greater polarity more dipole moment
so larger molecules have higher bp
yeah i thnk so size increases with polarity
so the greater the difference in charge of each ion, the greater the boiling point
so, the difference in charge and the radius squared are the factors that influence the boiling point in ionic liquids
molar mass in this case is most relevant to BP because shape is the same for all
so to sum up, the larger number of branches increases the bp for polar molecules
for polar ones I guess? for Nonpolar, more branches decreases BP
the factors influencing the boiling point are whether or not the molecules are branched and the size of the molecule
the more polar the molecule is, the stronger the attractive force to another molecule of the same time, and the harder it is to overcome that force
so the radius/ size of atoms involved and the charges affect the boiling point
so when size increases, the force decreases, and so does the ionic-ness
and when charge increases, the force increases, so ionic-ness increases
they are tetrahedral if they arent ionic so the dipoles would cancel each other out due to symmetry
Sn is the larges so th IMF are going to be the largest so I think that stannane will have the highest boiling point
SnH4 has a higher mass so it has a higher contact area so it agrees with what we said
bc lower dipole moment means lower imfs means lower bp
KCl has smallest radius, so highest force
dipole moment doesnt matter
bc the symmetry in the diethyl ether will make a lower dipole than methyl ethyl ether
so i think that vdW dipole moment and boiling point increase when you add F
so maybe the bp is different bc the vdW has a bigger impact
i think in the grand scheme of things, polarity is going to be more significant than dispersion
As far as I know, for non-polar moleculars, the atomic size determines how big the intremolecular force is
I would also say that the boiling point grows with van der waals area
I guess you can say that, Quinn, especialy for big atoms, the "weak" intermolecular interation is actually not that weak
I think the bigger intremolecular force is the higher the boiling point is
yes, I did. Van der Waals force is jsut London dispersion force( the force between non-polar molecules)
Also hydrogen bonding has a large effect on these molecules
I see, the dipole moment is determined by charge and the distance
actually I want to add something to nonpolar bonding,so London dispersion forces (van der Waal force) increses as tomic size increses
so as radius increases, the Coulomb force decreases
well we said earlier that dispersion force increases with atomic size
so the bigger molecular mass is, the higher the boiling point is 
has the most brances and making the boiling point lower
and how addition branching reduces the dispersion force and the boiling point
Dipole-Dipole moments are based on the difference in electronegativity of the molecule. The line with the butane based compounds have a bigger dipole moment than the propane based compounds, because they have a longer chain
ok well that would be size/surface area of molecule- greater surface area=greater/stronger dispersion forces. branched means less surrface area so therefore weaker dispersion forces in nonpolar molecules
polar is based on difference in electronegativity, whether the molecule is hydrogen bonded, and the size of the molecule
stannane has the highest because it has the greatest atomic mass, and therefore the strongest dispersion forces
yes. bigger dipole moment. My guess is bigger surface area because fluorine is bigger than hydrogen
Haha, well, basically, the higher the dipole moment, the higher the boiling point
still the same, dipole moments are nowhere near as strong as ionic force
isnt vdW have to do w/ nonpolar
Dipole is 0 because of symmetry
because when radius is smaller the bp increases
ok well because the electronegative elemnts are being added to it, it creates a shorter bond length because it pulls closer, so BP increases
chloromethanes are same as bromomethanes
so what is going on is isomers with larger dipole moments have higher boiling points
and also molecules with OH groups have even higher boiling points because they have hydrogen bonding
so i can tell charges of consisting ions positively relate to the boiling points of molecules... if i am right
isobutanol, if it has a lower surface area, will have a higher boiling point
i think the position of the oxygen will have more of an impact than the van der waals though
yeah the ionic character is more important than the dipole
the molecule can be completely symetrical and that would end up in a net dipole of 0
I think the boiling point seems to correlate with the size of molecule
meaning that larger molecule has higher boiling point
yeah, and also branched molecules seem to have lower boiling point that unbranched ones
A larger difference in electronegativity makes the boiling point higher
they are isomers so the type of branching and bonds affect the bp
it should be higher since it has hydrogen bonding which they aren't showing
