with alkanes, branching them reduces their van der waals forces
more electrons -> more electron variation -> more van der waals forces
if the molecules sort of 'compact', ie a cyclic molecule, they will also have a stronger dispersion force
the unbranched molecules have a higher boiling point than the branched ones, suggesting that the unbranched molecules have stronger van der waals force
Yeah. branching decreases the vanderwaals forces, decreasing the boiling point. This is because they 'compact' well, letting them have a higher sort of surface area between them
more mass causes greater polarity more dipole moment
larger molecules have higher bp
the greater the difference in charge of each ion, the greater the boiling point
the difference in charge and the radius squared are the factors that influence the boiling point in ionic liquids
molar mass is most relevant to BP when the molecules have the same shape
the larger number of branches increases the bp for polar molecules
for nonpolar, more branches decreases BP
the factors influencing the boiling point are whether or not the molecules are branched and the size of the molecule
the more polar the molecule is, the stronger the attractive force to another molecule of the same time, and the harder it is to overcome that force
the radius of atoms involved and the charges affect the boiling point
when size increases, the force decreases, and so does the ionic-ness
when charge increases, the force increases, so ionic-ness increases
the dipoles would cancel each other out due to symmetry
if a molecule has a higher mass, it has a higher contact area
lower dipole moment means lower imfs means lower BP
dipole moment doesn't matter for some comparisons
vdW, dipole moment, and boiling point increase when you add Flourine
in the grand scheme of things, polarity is going to be more significant than dispersion
for non-polar moleculars, the atomic size determines how big the intermolecular force is
the boiling point grows with van der waals area
the "weak" intermolecular interation is actually not that weak, especialy for big atoms
the bigger intermolecular force is, the higher the boiling point is
Van der Waals force is just London dispersion force (the force between non-polar molecules)
hydrogen bonding has a large effect on these molecules
the dipole moment is determined by charge and distance
for nonpolar bonding, London dispersion forces (van der Waal force) increses as atomic size increases
as radius increases, the Coulomb force decreases
dispersion force increases with atomic size
the bigger molecular mass is, the higher the boiling point is 
additional branching reduces the dispersion force and the boiling point
Dipole-Dipole moments are based on the difference in electronegativity of the molecule
greater surface area = greater/stronger dispersion forces. 
a branched molecule has less surface area so therefore weaker dispersion forces in nonpolar molecules
the higher the dipole moment, the higher the boiling point
dipole moments aren't nearly as strong as ionic force
dipole is 0 when the molecule is symmetric
isomers with larger dipole moments have higher boiling points
molecules with OH groups have even higher boiling points because they have hydrogen bonding
if it has a lower surface area, it will have a higher boiling point
the position of the oxygen will have more of an impact than the van der waals force
the ionic character is more important than the dipole
the molecule can be completely symetrical and that would end up in a net dipole of 0
a larger molecule has a higher boiling point
a larger difference in electronegativity makes the boiling point higher
for isomers, the type of branching and bonds affect the bp
