    <prompt strategy="task" id="AGENT_INTRODUCE">
        <text>Hi, I'm [AGENT NAME]. Throughout this activity, I will be facilitating your discussion about this Normal Distribution lab.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="INTRO">
        <text>Let's start by introducing yourselves. Give your name and favorite topic in this course, so far.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4_BACKGROUND">
    <text>We are now moving to Part 4 of this assignment which is about combining your data and analyzing the n=60 size data set. For this part, each team will have already completed Parts 1, 2 and 3 before this discussion. We will be focusing the discussion on your combined data and also how it compares to the two samples.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4_SHARE">
    <text>Share the URL for your spreadsheet with that of the other team.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4a">
    <text>You will be prompted to answer 8 questions. Statistically compare and contrast your results between the two teams. Each person should give either 1 similarity or 1 difference or both.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4b">
    <text>Open the Spreadsheet tab. One person from Team A post the 30 values in Column A. One person from Team B posts the 30 values in Column A, starting after Team A’s data. Discuss the symmetry of the histogram including comparisons of the mean and the median. What does this say about people’s finger length?</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4c">
    <text>How did the standard deviations change when you combined the data?  Why do you think this might be?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4d">
    <text>Find the interval that contains the pinkie length within two standard deviations of your mean. If all teammates do not agree on the answer, discuss it and convince each other you are correct.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4e">
    <text>What percent of the data are with two standard deviations of the mean?  Round to two decimal places. If all teammates do not agree on the answer, discuss it and try to convince your partners that you are correct.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4f">
    <text>According to the Normal distribution, what percent of the data would you expect to be within two standard deviations of the mean? Why?</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4g">
    <text>Discuss whether the combined data that you collected gives a close approximation to the Normal distribution?  Explain why or why not. Each person should contribute to the discussion.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="DISCUSS_4h">
    <text>State your recommendations to the client based on your results.  Be sure to include references to the Normal distribution.</text>
    </prompt>


    <prompt strategy="task" id="FINISH">
    <text>Now this activity has come to an end. Thanks for a great chat!</text>
