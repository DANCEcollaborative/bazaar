        <text>Hi, I'm Quinn. I'll be facilitating this group exercise. 
        I won't answer your questions directly, but I'll structure the activity and add a few comments to your discussion.</text>

        <text>Each of you is the expert for a different kind of compound - take a moment to review your individual training materials.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="INTRO_0">
        <text>We'll start by tying in to the specialized knowledge you got from your expert training -
         for each of the questions in this section, one of you (the expert for this kind of molecule) should be able to explain it to the rest. </text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="INTRO_1">
        <text>I'll post the first data set to the whiteboard - we'll move on when you all understand what factors are at play. |

        <text>Next section - you'll be presented with three compounds at a time. Predict how they'll compare in terms of boiling points, and justify your prediction.</text>
