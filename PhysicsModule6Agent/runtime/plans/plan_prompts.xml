        <text>Click on the Sharing Space to the left. The image shows a metal bar of length L that moves at constant velocity v-> through a magnetic field B-> that points into the paper (as shown by the crosses in the figure).</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A2">
        <text>Redraw the bar, and indicate how the charges in the bar are redistributed due to the force that the magnetic field exerts on them. Upload a URL for your image into the Sharing Space.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A3">
        <text>This charge redistribution (that you just drew) produces an electric field inside the bar that prevents further charge redistribution. Draw the E-> field lines inside the bar. Upload a URL for your image into the Sharing Space.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A4">
        <text>Apply Newton’s second law to a charge in the middle of the bar—now it is in an electric field and in a magnetic field, and it is in equilibrium. Draw a force diagram and your mathematical representation, and upload the URL into the Sharing Space.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A5">   
        <text>Use the expression that relates the E-> field magnitude component E_y (direction perpendicular to the velocity of the bar) and the potential difference over a distance ∆V/L with the previous results to determine an expression for the potential difference between the ends of the bar.</text>

        <text>Let’s apply this result to a real-life application. Refer to the new image in the Sharing Space.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B2">
        <text>A major artery has a diameter d of 1 cm. A magnetic flow meter clamped around the artery sets up a region of magnetic field B = 0.20 T. The flow meter measures a potential difference of 2 x 10^-3 V  between opposite sides of the artery. Positive and negative ions flow through the artery at a speed v as shown in the diagram.|Discuss and make sure you understand the diagram.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B3">
        <text>You want to estimate the speed of the blood flowing through the artery. As a first step, draw the force exerted on a + ion and on a – ion flowing in the blood by the external magnetic field. Do you agree on the direction of each force?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B4">
        <text>Next, draw a charge diagram showing how the + and – ions accumulate on the walls of the artery.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B5">
        <text>Draw a force diagram for a + ion that travels straight through the middle of the artery because F_(E on q) balances F_(B on q).</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B6">
        <text>Use your equation relating F_(E on q) and F_(B on q) to solve for the electric field magnitude E.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B7">
        <text>Use the expression that relates the E-> field magnitude E and the potential difference over the diameter of the artery ∆V/d with your previous results to determine an expression for the speed v of the ions in the artery.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B8">
        <text>What is the speed of the ions?</text>
