        <text>At WGU Academy, we like to set SMARTER goals. "SMARTER" stands for: Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-Bound, Evaluate, and Reward. | By making SMARTER goals, we are setting ourselves up for success to complete our funnel. For example, instead of saying "I will do well in my English course," try setting a SMARTER goal such as "I will complete my Personal Narrative assignment in 1 week by setting aside one hour each evening to work on it. Along the way, I will evaluate my progress, and when I finish, I will celebrate with my family!"
