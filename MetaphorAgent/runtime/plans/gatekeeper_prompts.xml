     <text>Here's a hint in case you are stuck ...|||The two transactions may be decomposed into four actions: "buying transaction #1","selling transaction #1","buying transaction #2" and "selling transaction #2". Over the iterations, consider calculating four variables which correspond to the costs or the profits of each action respectively in the two transactions. Use min() and max() to update these four variables iteratively.</text>
