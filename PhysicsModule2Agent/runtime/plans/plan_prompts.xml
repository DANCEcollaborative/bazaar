        <text>Share something about yourself, such as, what colour best captures how you are feeling today? I am feeling dark green.</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A1">
        <text>Your textbook’s authors video-recorded two experiments, both using the same concave mirror. Watch the video of Experiment 1 in the "Video 1" tab to the left. When you have completed watching the video, briefly discuss what you observed.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A2">
        <text>Draw a ray diagram to explain why, when the screen and the source are at a particular distance from the mirror, you see a sharp inverted image of the candle.|Each of you should paste a URL for your diagram into the Sharing Space, then discuss.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A3">
        <text>Use the ray diagram to determine the focal distance of the mirror. If you have extra time, include the experimental uncertainty in your value.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B1">
        <text>Watch the video of Experiment 2 in the "Video 2" tab to the left. The light bulb (serving as a point-like source in this experiment) is positioned on the principal axis of the mirror. Type "ready" when you have watched the video.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B2">
        <text>Explain why, when the point-like light source is at a certain distance from the mirror, there is a circle on the screen that matches the size of the mirror.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B3">
        <text>Now use a ray diagram to determine the focal distance of the mirror based on Experiment 2. If you have time, include the experimental uncertainty in your value.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B4">
        <text>Compare the values you found from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. If you included experimental uncertainty, answer the question: are the values the same or different?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_C1">
        <text>We will move on now to the last experiment today. Watch the video with a candle, a lens, and a screen in the "Video 3" tab to the left. When you have completed watching the video type "ready".</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_C2">
        <text>Why does the sharp image of the candle appear twice during the experiment in the video? Draw ray diagrams to support your explanation.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_C3">
        <text>As time permits, use the video to collect data to determine the focal distance of the lens used in the experiment. Note that you can pause the video and press the period key to advance the video frame by frame.</text>
