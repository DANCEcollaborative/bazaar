        <text>Hi! I'm LabAssistant. I'll hold tight until both teammates have joined the discussion.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="WELCOME_CONTEXT">
        <text>Once everyone is ready, we'll tackle three wizard riddles together using the virtual lab.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_QUESTION">
        <text>Part 1 — Use the first virtual lab tab to uncover the reaction behind the opening clue. Talk it through, then each teammate type ready:part1 when prepared. Submit answers in chat as reaction: REACTANTS-&gt;PRODUCTS (for example, reaction: A+2C-&gt;B+D).</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_COLLAB">
        <text>Compare notes before you lock in an answer. What observations or tests support your Part 1 reaction?</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_SUBMIT_PROMPT">
        <text>When you're ready, send me your reaction as reaction: REACTANTS->PRODUCTS. You have up to three tries, so double-check before you submit.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_REACTANT_FEEDBACK">
        <text>Your reactants line up with the clue. Revisit the products to finish the equation.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_PRODUCT_FEEDBACK">
        <text>The products make sense. Check which reactants should combine to produce them.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_STOICHIOMETRY_FEEDBACK">
        <text>The substances look correct, but the stoichiometric ratios need adjusting.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_GENERAL_FEEDBACK">
        <text>That combination doesn't match the wizard's clue yet. Re-examine both reactants and products before trying again.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_CORRECT">
        <text>Great! Your Part 1 reaction matches the wizard's clue.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_RETRY">
        <text>Not quite. You have [ATTEMPTS_LEFT] attempt(s) left for Part 1. Revisit your evidence and adjust the reaction together.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_FAILURE">
        <text>We'll reveal the wizard's Part 1 solution and keep moving.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_SOLUTION">
        <text><![CDATA[<div class="wizard-solution"><strong>Wizard's Part 1 solution:</strong> $$0.1\,	ext{L} 	imes rac{1.0\,	ext{mol A}}{1\,	ext{L}} = 0.10\,	ext{mol A}$$</div>]]></text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_QUESTION">
        <text>Part 2 — Open the second lab tab (Part 2) and determine the reaction for the next clue. When both of you are ready, type ready:part2. Submit each attempt as reaction: REACTANTS-&gt;PRODUCTS.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_COLLAB">
        <text>Share your observations from the new setup before sending an answer. What evidence confirms your Part 2 reaction?</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_SUBMIT_PROMPT">
        <text>Type your answer as reaction: REACTANTS->PRODUCTS. Remember, you have up to three attempts for Part 2.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_REACTANT_FEEDBACK">
        <text>Your starting substances look right. Revisit what they should form in the second step.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_PRODUCT_FEEDBACK">
        <text>The products check out. Double-check which reactants should lead to them.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_STOICHIOMETRY_FEEDBACK">
        <text>Reactants and products look solid—tune the coefficients to balance the equation.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_GENERAL_FEEDBACK">
        <text>That equation doesn't line up with the wizard's instructions. Revisit both sides and try another balanced reaction.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_CORRECT">
        <text>Nice work! That reaction satisfies the wizard's second clue.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_RETRY">
        <text>That doesn't quite fit. [ATTEMPTS_LEFT] attempt(s) remain for Part 2 — double-check coefficients and products.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART2_FAILURE">
        <text>Let's review the wizard's Part 2 solution and continue.</text>

        <text><![CDATA[<div class="wizard-solution"><strong>Wizard's Part 2 solutions include:</strong><div class="wizard-equation">$$A + 2C \rightarrow B + D$$</div><div class="wizard-equation">$$B + 2C \rightarrow E$$</div></div>]]></text>
