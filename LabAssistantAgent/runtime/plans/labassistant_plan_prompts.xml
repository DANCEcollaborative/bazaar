        <text>Hi! I'm LabAssistant. Let us wait until both teammates have joined the discussion.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="WELCOME_CONTEXT">
        <text>Once everyone is ready, we'll tackle three different parts of our experiment in the Virtual Lab.</text>
    </prompt>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_QUESTION">
        <text>Part 1 - Mix A and B and use the species viewer to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction between A and B, including the stoichiometric coefficients. You will find 1 M solutions of each reagent in the stockroom. Talk it through, then each teammate type <span style="color:#d9534f; font-weight:bold;">ready:part1</span> when prepared.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_COLLAB">
        <text>Compare notes before you lock in an answer. What observations or tests support your Part 1 reaction?</text>

        <text>Send me your reaction as <span style="color:#0275d8; font-weight:bold;">reaction: REACTANTS-&gt;PRODUCTS</span> (e.g. <span style="color:#0275d8; font-weight:bold;">reaction: X+Y-&gt;Z</span>). You have up to three tries, so double-check before you submit.</text>

        <text>Part 2 — Open the second lab tab (Part 2). Mix the available reagents and use the species viewer to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction, including the stoichiometric coefficients.
