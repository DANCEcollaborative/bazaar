    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_QUESTION">
        <text>Part 1 - Mix A and B and use the species viewer to determine the stoichiometry of the reaction between A and B, including the stoichiometric coefficients. You will find 1 M solutions of each reagent in the stockroom. Talk it through together.</text>
    </prompt>
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PART1_COLLAB">
        <text>Compare notes before you lock in an answer. What observations or tests support your Part 1 reaction? Use the document in the "Scratchpad" tab to record your observations. When each teammate is ready, type <span style="color:#d9534f; font-weight:bold;">ready:part1</span>.</text>
