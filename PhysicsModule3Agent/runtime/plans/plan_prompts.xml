    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A1">
        <text>Click on the "Sharing Space" at the left to see an image of a Morpho butterfly.|A reflection grating reflects light from adjacent lines in the grating instead of allowing the light to pass through slits, as is the case with the so-called transmission gratings we have been studying. Interference between the reflected light waves produces reflection maxima.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A2">
        <text>The angular deflection of bright bands, assuming perpendicular incidence, is calculated using the same equation as the angular deflection of transmitted light through a regular grating.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A2a">
        <text>White light is incident on the wing of a Morpho butterfly (whose wings act as a reflection grating). Why do you see different color bands coming from the wings of the butterfly when white light shines on the wings?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A3">
        <text>Red light of wavelength 660 nm is deflected in first order (n = 1) at an angle of 1.2 degrees. Determine the distance between the adjacent reflecting lines on the butterfly's wing.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A4">
        <text>As you work, remember to respond to one another and show each step in Problem-Solving Strategy 24.1 (“sketch and translate”, “simplify and diagram”, “represent mathematically”, “solve and evaluate”).</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A5">
        <text>Now determine the angular deflection in first order (n = 1) of blue light (460 nm) incident on the butterfly’s wing.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B1">
        <text>We will now move on to an application. An image of stars is displayed in the Sharing Space.|You may have noticed that stars have different colors—-some are white, some are yellowish, and some are reddish. Does this mean that stars of a red color do not emit any blue light?</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B2">
        <text>Astronomers use an instrument called a spectrograph to analyze the color composition of starlight. The central mechanism of a spectrograph is a grating. Working with your group, design a simple version of a spectrograph, an apparatus that will allow you to separate different colors of light emitted by a lamp on your desk (that emits light very similar to the light emitted by many stars) and will also allow you to measure the wavelengths of these different colors.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_B3">
        <text>Draw a picture of the apparatus you’re designing, upload its URL into the Sharing Space, and explain how it works.</text>

        <text>The activity is complete now. If you are curious to learn more about the colour of the wings of a morpho butterfly (beyond this class), please see the “introduction” section of <a href="https://aapt-scitation-org.myaccess.library.utoronto.ca/doi/10.1119/1.3192768">this article</a>.|Note that you may save your discussion for future studying using the “Download Discussion Log” button.
