text, classfilms adapted from comic books have had plenty of success  whether theyre about superheroes ( batman  superman  spawn )  or geared toward kids ( casper ) or the arthouse crowd ( ghost world )  but theres never really been a comic book like from hell before .  for starters  it was created by alan moore ( and eddie campbell )  who brought the medium to a whole new level in the mid 80s with a 12-part series called the watchmen .  to say moore and campbell thoroughly researched the subject of jack the ripper would be like saying michael jackson is starting to look a little odd .  the book ( or  graphic novel   if you will ) is over 500 pages long and includes nearly 30 more that consist of nothing but footnotes .  in other words  dont dismiss this film because of its source .  if you can get past the whole comic book thing  you might find another stumbling block in from hells directors  albert and allen hughes .  getting the hughes brothers to direct this seems almost as ludicrous as casting carrot top in  well  anything  but riddle me this : who better to direct a film thats set in the ghetto and features really violent street crime than the mad geniuses behind menace ii society ?  the ghetto in question is  of course  whitechapel in 1888 londons east end .  its a filthy  sooty place where the whores ( called  unfortunates  ) are starting to get a little nervous about this mysterious psychopath who has been carving through their profession with surgical precision .  when the first stiff turns up  copper peter godley ( robbie coltrane  the world is not enough ) calls in inspector frederick abberline ( johnny depp  blow ) to crack the case .  abberline  a widower  has prophetic dreams he unsuccessfully tries to quell with copious amounts of absinthe and opium .  upon arriving in whitechapel  he befriends an unfortunate named mary kelly ( heather graham  say it isnt so ) and proceeds to investigate the horribly gruesome crimes that even the police surgeon cant stomach .  i dont think anyone needs to be briefed on jack the ripper  so i wont go into the particulars here  other than to say moore and campbell have a unique and interesting theory about both the identity of the killer and the reasons he chooses to slay .  in the comic  they dont bother cloaking the identity of the ripper  but screenwriters terry hayes ( vertical limit ) and rafael yglesias ( les mis ? rables ) do a good job of keeping him hidden from viewers until the very end .  its funny to watch the locals blindly point the finger of blame at jews and indians because  after all  an englishman could never be capable of committing such ghastly acts .  and from hells ending had me whistling the stonecutters song from the simpsons for days (  who holds back the electric car/who made steve guttenberg a star ?  ) .  dont worry - itll all make sense when you see it .  now onto from hells appearance : its certainly dark and bleak enough  and its surprising to see how much more it looks like a tim burton film than planet of the apes did ( at times  it seems like sleepy hollow 2 ) .  the print i saw wasnt completely finished ( both color and music had not been finalized  so no comments about marilyn manson )  but cinematographer peter deming ( dont say a word ) ably captures the dreariness of victorian-era london and helped make the flashy killing scenes remind me of the crazy flashbacks in twin peaks  even though the violence in the film pales in comparison to that in the black-and-white comic .  oscar winner martin childs ( shakespeare in love ) production design turns the original prague surroundings into one creepy place .  even the acting in from hell is solid  with the dreamy depp turning in a typically strong performance and deftly handling a british accent .  ians holm ( joe goulds secret ) and richardson ( 102 dalmatians ) log in great supporting roles  but the big surprise here is graham .  i cringed the first time she opened her mouth  imagining her attempt at an irish accent  but it actually wasnt half bad .  the film  however  is all good .  2 : 00 - r for strong violence/gore  sexuality  language and drug content  , POSevery now and then a movie comes along from a suspect studio  with every indication that it will be a stinker  and to everybodys surprise ( perhaps even the studio ) the film becomes a critical darling .  mtv films _election  a high school comedy starring matthew broderick and reese witherspoon  is a current example .  did anybody know this film existed a week before it opened ?  the plot is deceptively simple .  george washington carver high school is having student elections .  tracy flick ( reese witherspoon ) is an over-achiever with her hand raised at nearly every question  way  way  high .  mr .  m  ( matthew broderick )  sick of the megalomaniac student  encourages paul  a popular-but-slow jock to run .  and pauls nihilistic sister jumps in the race as well  for personal reasons .  the dark side of such sleeper success is that  because expectations were so low going in  the fact that this was quality stuff made the reviews even more enthusiastic than they have any right to be .  you cant help going in with the baggage of glowing reviews  which is in contrast to the negative baggage that the reviewers were likely to have .  _election  a good film  does not live up to its hype .  what makes _election_ so disappointing is that it contains significant plot details lifted directly from _rushmore_  released a few months earlier .  the similarities are staggering :  tracy flick ( _election_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs  and is involved with the school play .  max fischer ( _rushmore_ ) is the president of an extraordinary number of clubs  and is involved with the school play .  the most significant tension of _election_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .  the most significant tension of _rushmore_ is the potential relationship between a teacher and his student .  tracy flick is from a single parent home  which has contributed to her drive .  max fischer is from a single parent home  which has contributed to his drive .  the male bumbling adult in _election_ ( matthew broderick ) pursues an extramarital affair  gets caught  and his whole life is ruined .  he even gets a bee sting .  the male bumbling adult in _rushmore_ ( bill murray ) pursues an extramarital affair  gets caught  and his whole life is ruined .  he gets several bee stings .  and so on .  what happened ?  how is it that an individual screenplay ( _rushmore_ ) and a novel ( _election_ ) contain so many significant plot points  and yet both films were probably not even aware of each other  made from two different studios  from a genre ( the high school geeks revenge movie ) that hadnt been fully formed yet ?  even so  the strengths of _election_ rely upon its fantastic performances from broderick  witherspoon  and newcomer jessica campbell  as pauls anti-social sister  tammy .  broderick here is playing the mr . rooney role from _ferris bueller_  and he seems to be having the most fun hes had since then .  witherspoon is a revelation .  its early in the year  its a comedy  and teenagers have little clout  but for my money  witherspoon deserves an oscar nomination .  and once campbells character gets going  like in her fantastic speech in the gymnasium  then youre won over .  one thing thats been bothering me since ive seen it .  there is an extraordinary amount of sexuality in this film .  i suppose that  coming from mtv films  i should expect no less . . .  but the film starts off light and airy  like a sitcom .  as the screws tighten  and the tensions mount  alexander payne decides to add elements that  frankly  distract from the story .  it is bad enough that mr . m doesnt like tracys determination to win at all costs  but did they have to throw in the student/teacher relationship ?  even so  theres no logical reason why mr . m has an affair when he does .  theres a lot to like in _election_  but the plot similarities to _rushmore_  and the tonal nosedive it takes as it gets explicitly sex-driven  mark this as a disappointment .  , POSyouve got mail works alot better than it deserves to .  in order to make the film a success  all they had to do was cast two extremely popular and attractive stars  have them share the screen for about two hours and then collect the profits .  no real acting was involved and there is not an original or inventive bone in its body ( its basically a complete re-shoot of the shop around the corner  only adding a few modern twists ) .  essentially  it goes against and defies all concepts of good contemporary filmmaking .  its overly sentimental and at times terribly mushy  not to mention very manipulative .  but oh  how enjoyable that manipulation is .  but there must be something other than the casting and manipulation that makes the movie work as well as it does  because i absolutely hated the previous ryan/hanks teaming  sleepless in seattle .  it couldnt have been the directing  because both films were helmed by the same woman .  i havent quite yet figured out what i liked so much about youve got mail  but then again  is that really important ?  if you like something so much  why even question it ?  again  the storyline is as cliched as they come .  tom hanks plays joe fox  the insanely likeable owner of a discount book chain and meg ryan plays kathleen kelley  the even more insanely likeable proprietor of a family-run childrens book shop called  in a nice homage  the shop around the corner .  fox and kelley soon become bitter rivals because the new fox books store is opening up right across the block from the small business .  little do they know  they are already in love with each other over the internet  only neither party knows the other persons true identity .  the rest of the story isnt important because all it does is serve as a mere backdrop for the two stars to share the screen .  sure  there are some mildly interesting subplots  but they all fail in comparison to the utter cuteness of the main relationship .  all of this  of course  leads up to the predictable climax .  but as foreseeable as the ending is  its so damn cute and well-done that i doubt any movie in the entire year contains a scene the evokes as much pure joy as this part does .  when ryan discovers the true identity of her online love  i was filled with such  for lack of a better word  happiness that for the first time all year  i actually left the theater smiling .  , POS  jaws  is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen .  the movie opens with blackness  and only distant  alien-like underwater sounds .  then it comes  the first ominous bars of composer john williams now infamous score .  dah-dum .  from there  director steven spielberg wastes no time  taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly .  right away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean  and once  jaws  has attacked  it never relinquishes its grip .  perhaps what is most outstanding about  jaws  is how spielberg builds the movie .  he works it like a theatrical production  with a first act and a second act .  unlike so many modern filmmakers  he has a great deal of restraint  and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act .  until then  he merely suggests its presence with creepy  subjective underwater shots and williams music .  hes building the tension bit by bit  so when it comes time for the climax  the sharks arrival is truly terrifying .  he doesnt let us get bored with the imagery .  the first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider )  a new york cop who has taken an easy  peaceful job running the police station on amity island  a fictitious new england resort town where there hasnt been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years .  the island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july  and the mayor  larry vaughn ( murray hamilton )  doesnt want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money .  brody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss )  a young  ambitious shark expert from the marine institute .  hooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark (  its a perfect engine  an eating machine  ) make it that much more terrifying .  when vaughn finally relents  hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat  the orca  to search for the shark .  the entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark  and inevitably  are hunted by it .    jaws  is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing  tension  and horror .  it is like ten movies all rolled into one  and its no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975  taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by  star wars  ) .  even today  fascination with this film is on par with hitchcocks  psycho   and it never seems to age .  although grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences  including several mechanical sharks  obsolete  none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill .  the technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing  characterization  sharp editing  and creative photography  instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects .  scheider  dreyfuss  and shaw were known actors at the time  jaws  was made  but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman .  nevertheless  this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark .  scheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing whats right and going against the entire town .    its your first summer here  you know   mayor vaughn warns him .  dreyfuss  who had previously been seen in  american graffiti  ( 1973 ) and  the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz  ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature  complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers .  however  most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movies captain ahab  a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards .  bordering of parody  shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism .  hes slightly deranged  and shaws performance is almost a caricature .  however  there is one scene late in the film  when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars .  quint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s .  indianapolis  a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese .  his tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1  000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen .  shaw delivers the story in one long take  and it is the best acting in the film .  of course  we cant leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes  endless rows of teeth  and insatiable urge to eat  it is basically the epitome of all mankinds fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature .  a shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs  great whites do exist  they can be as large as the shark in  jaws   and they are a threat .  every one of spielbergs subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing  dangling  completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into .  the shark in  jaws  was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed  bruce  by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles .  many have forgotten  but  jaws  was a sort of precursor to  waterworld  ( 1995 )  a movies who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb .  but  as we can see now  spielberg overcame all the obstacles  and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood .  , POSmoviemaking is a lot like being the general manager of an nfl team in the post-salary cap era -- youve got to know how to allocate your resources .  every dollar spent on a free-agent defensive tackle is one less dollar than you can spend on linebackers or safeties or centers .  in the nfl  this leads to teams like the detroit lions  who boast a superstar running back with a huge contract  but can only field five guys named herb to block for him .  in the movies  you end up with films like  spawn   with a huge special-effects budget but not enough money to hire any recognizable actors .  jackie chan is the barry sanders of moviemaking .  he spins and darts across the screen like sanders cutting back through the defensive line .  watching jackie in operation condor as he drives his motorcycle through the crowded streets of madrid  fleeing an armada of pursuers in identical black compact cars  is reminiscent of sanders running for daylight with the chicago bears in hot pursuit  except that sanders doesnt have to worry about rescuing runaway baby carriages .  but like the lions star  jackie doesnt have anybody to block for him .  almost every cent thats invested in a jackie chan movie goes for stunts  and as chan does his own stunts  the rest of the money goes to pay his hospital bills .  this leaves about 75 cents to pay for things like directors ( chan directs )  scripts and dubbing and supporting characters  not to mention the hideous title sequence .  this also explains why the movie was shot in odd places like morocco and spain .   ( chans first release in this country   rumble in the bronx   was supposedly set in new york  but was filmed in vancouver  and in the chase scenes the canadian rockies are clearly visible . )  heck  jackie doesnt even have enough money for a haircut  looks like  much less a personal hairstylist .  in condor  chan plays the same character hes always played  himself  a mixture of bruce lee and tim allen  a master of both kung-fu and slapstick-fu .  jackie is sent by the un to retrieve a cache of lost nazi gold in the north african desert  and is chased by a horde of neo-nazi sympathizers and two stereotypical arabs ( one of the things i like about jackie chan movies : no political correctness ) .  he is joined by three women  who have little to do except scream   jackie  save us !   and misuse firearms .  the villain is an old nazi whose legs were broken in the secret base so that he has to be carried everywhere  and hes more pathetic than evil .  en route  we have an extended motorcycle chase scene  a hilarious fight in the moroccan version of motel 6 with the neo-nazis  and two confrontations with savage natives .  once at the secret desert base  there is a long chop-socky sequence  followed by the films centerpiece  a wind-tunnel fight thats even better than the one in face/off .  this is where the money was spent  on well-choreographed kung-fu sequences  on giant kevlar hamster balls  on smashed-up crates of bananas  and on scorpions .  ignore the gaping holes in the plot ( how  exactly  if the villains legs were broken  did he escape from the secret nazi base  and why didnt he take the key with him ? ) .  dont worry about the production values  or what  exactly  the japanese girl was doing hitchhiking across the sahara .  just go see the movie .  operation condor has pretentions of being a  raiders of the lost ark  knockoff  but one wonders what jackie could do with the raiders franchise blocking for him -- with a lawrence kazdan screenplay  a john williams score  spielberg directing and george lucas producing  condor might be an a+ movie .  however  youve got to go with what youve got  and what youve got in jackie chan is something special -- a talent that mainstream hollywood should  could  and ought to utilize .  , POSon june 30  1960  a self-taught  idealistic  yet pragmatic  young man became  at age 36  the first head of government of a newly independent african state  formerly the belgian congo .  two months later  he was ousted from his powerful position and hunted by government troops until he was captured and brutally murdered along with two aides .  this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in  lumumba .   patrice lumumbas ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary   lumumba - death of a prophet   virtually guaranteeing that his new  fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject .  peck  with co-writer pascal bonitzer  begins at the end of the story of the young political leader .  we watch as two white men perform the gruesome task of dismembering the bodies of three black men .  images of hatchets  saws and fast-emptying whiskey bottles accompany the grisly image .  jump back a few years to a meeting among the black leaders in the belgian-owned congo .  a third class postal worker  lumumba  speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes  proclaiming himself not tribal  not regional  but a national leader .  his small  mobile party  the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer  and get his face known  in the bustling capital  stanleyville .  at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world  lumumba is in the right place at the right time and  through political savvy and chess-like manipulation  achieves a position of leadership of the mnc .  as the date for independence approaches  he tactically positions himself to be the new nations first prime minister and defense minister  supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) .  the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the countrys vast natural resources of copper  diamonds  gold and more .  lumumba wont seek the help of the us  knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government .  his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination .  the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies  the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves  belgian troops violently intervene  the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad .  this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries .  peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba  his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50s and 60s .   ( during the time the story takes place  many new nations  including nigeria and somalia  were born  with varying degrees of success and failure  usually dependent upon which country colonized them .  some colonial masters were better than others . )  the effort involved in  lumumba  is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades  if at all .  production values are first rate on what must be a small  by us standards  budget .  the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique .  the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeomans work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumbas life .  the political side of things is evenly told in a linear  straightforward manner that teaches  not preaches .  it concentrates on the good deeds of the man  if a bit as a stalwart saint  but doesnt embellish on a larger than life persona .  the family side of patrices life is handled in several  perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children  embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child .  i know the intent is to flesh the man out  but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba .  the story  as such  has a lopsided feel about it .  high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character .  the actor gives a convincing  charismatic performance as the multifaceted  politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions .  in true docudrama tradition  the supporting cast does not outshine the star  complementing his good efforts  instead .    lumumba  is a solid  interesting  educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos  both .  it has more intelligence in its telling than anything ive seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ .  , POSapparently  director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film  american history x . i dont know the details of the fight  but it seems that he is not happy with the final product  and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .  ive heard about this kind of thing happening before  and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce .  as it is  i found american history x to be an extremely good film  not just because of tony kayes focused look at the touchy subject of racism  but because of a powerful  charismatic performance from edward norton .  its hard to believe that it has only been two years since nortons fantastic role in primal fear  but  here he is now  starring in his own film and making himself a star .  norton is one of those performers who becomes his character  and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .  he plays a young man named derek vinyard  a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother  danny ( edward furlong )  mother ( beverly dangelo )  and sister  davin ( jennifer lien ) .  the film opens with a flashback  in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .  we find out that this lands him in prison  and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .  in the present-time of the film  danny is in high school  and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .  much of the film is told in flashback  and we see the path that leads to dereks adoption of white supremacy .  when derek is released  having served three years in prison  he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek  however  has given up the violence  and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .  what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid  thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate  and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .  its hard to make a controversial movie and not preach  but kaye has found the right note for his material .  because american history x is a mainstream film  there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .  i partially disagree with this  because  although i do not advocate racism in any way  its interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud  obnoxious man  but hes also very smart .  the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .  its clear that hes passionate about his beliefs  and that hes not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .  of course  it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .  its astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .  in addition to getting the look just right  hes perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence  depth  and a whole lot of shouting  and norton does it all with ease .  even when hes at his meanest  derek has a likable quality to him  and thats a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .  what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of dannys school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .  the other performances are all terrific  with standouts from furlong  dangelo  and lien .  visually  the film is very powerful .  kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices  and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .  but  like a lot of movies lately  american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .  although the climactic scene is very moving  the picture ends with a pretentious  preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .  for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point  it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .  it makes me wonder what  exactly  tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .  perhaps this last scene was the problem .  its hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak  american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .  , POSone of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsys wedding .  and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .  her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald  who hasnt made a worthwhile film since 1986 .  but the fact is  betsys wedding is also an alan alda film .  and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years  alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects  including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .  written and directed by alda  betsys wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life  mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .  aldas comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .  as bride and groom  molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film  but they are by far the least interesting .  walsh is a nonentity  with all the screen presence of a door knob .  ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .  she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair  red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .  shes supposed to be a dress designer  but she looks more like a clown .  and to make matters worse  ringwalds performance matches her appearance .  thankfully  alda keeps ringwalds screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .  the wedding is just a device to bring together the brides working-class  italian family and the grooms rich  gentile family .  ringwalds folks are homey and down-to-earth  with alda as her free-spirited father  madeline kahn as her practical mother  and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .  walshs clan  on the other hand  is prim  proper and ostentatious .  when the two families meet and mingle  the movie becomes a story of culture clash  or as one character puts it   money versus values .   ally sheedy  in a wonderfully understated performance  is one of the films most pleasant surprises .  sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .  its anthony lapaglia  however  who seizes the spotlight .  lapaglia plays stevie dee  a suave  overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .  lapaglias sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .  and whats uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro  with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .  lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting  and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .  i dont know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born  but i do know that lapaglias over-the-top performance should not be missed .  the scrumptious comic acting  however  extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .  joe pesci  in particular  sinks his teeth into his role as aldas unscrupulous brother-in-law  a slum lord with mob ties  who is cheating on his wife ( catherine ohara ) .  alda  faced with challenge of both directing and acting  somehow finds just the right comic touch as the brides financially-strapped father  a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .  the film adopts aldas psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding  and two : pay for it .  as a filmmaker  aldas style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .  and while he doesnt have the comic genius of a woody allen  alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .  , POSafter bloody clashes and independence won  lumumba refused to pander to the belgians  who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .  their officers  particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique  the congos army  caused rebellions  undermining lumumba  who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals .  with unrest building  moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga  which contained 70 percent of the countrys resources  proclaimed secession .  lumumba replaced janssens  making mobutu a colonel  and went on a pacification  tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto )  but it was too late .  when you want to drown a dog  you say it has rabies   prophesies lumumba of his own fate .  peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players  although they frequently succumb to cliche  particularly regarding lumumbas private life .  pecks script illuminates bantu sayings like the hand that gives  rules when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador .  pecks direction is less assured  with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare .  hes served well  though  by his casting of ebouaney in the title role .  ebouaney is dynamic  radiating his characters fierce passion for his people and his country .  lumumbas intelligence and ability to strategize  even as hes cornered by insurmountable odds  are given life by ebouaney .  pecks subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production .    lumumba  is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaneys performance makes the tragedy personally felt .  , POSthe american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats .  its not a pretty death  and its leaving the likes of schwartznager  stallone  and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .  sometimes  the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other .  quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work  as in 1999s the matrix  can be a real gem .  but too often hollywood gets it wrong  even when they pay off chinese directors .  flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .  mostly its laughable .  in hollywoods rush to emulate the success of the matrix  trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .  but iron monkey  the latest asian import  shows us how to get it right .  iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu )  fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .  but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong  most recently seen in one of the most overlooked  and possibly best films of 2000  drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .  unlike drunken master 2  which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong  iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkeys fight against oppression .  iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times  fighting styles  especially that of monkey himself  do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger  hidden dragon  director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .  iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore  kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .  however  there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters  such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy  chief fox .  in those moments  and in others  iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .  while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2  iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .  aka siunin wong fei-hung tsi titmalau .  , POSafter watching  rat race  last week  i noticed my cheeks were sore and realized that  when not laughing aloud  i had held a grin for virtually all of the films 112 minutes .  saturday night  i attended another sneak preview for the movie and damned if i didnt enjoy it as much the second time as the first .    rat race  is a great goofy delight  a dandy mix of energetic performances  inspired sight gags and flat-out silliness .  hands down  this is the most fun film of the summer .  the movie begins with zippy retro-style opening credits that look like they were torn straight out of a 60s slapstick comedy  featuring animated photos of the cast attached to herky-jerky bodies bounding around the screen .  then comes the setup .  donald sinclair ( john cleese )  the extremely rich owner of the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas  enjoys concocting unusual bets for his high rolling clients .  to that end  he places a half dozen very special tokens in his slot machines .  gathering together the lucky token holders  he explains   today you have a chance to play a game where the odds of winning are one in six .   the competition is simple : each contestant gets a key that opens a locker in silver city  n . m .  containing $2 million in cash .  there is a transmitter in every key  so that sinclair and his cronies can keep track of who is ahead .  the race has no rules ? whichever contestant reaches the locker first gets the money .  since it would be wrong to spoil any of the jokes  lets use the next few paragraphs to profile the racers .  decked out in flashy  trashy clothing and sporting big hair  vera baker ( whoopi goldberg ) is in town to reunite with the daughter she gave up for adoption as a baby .  she finds that grown-up merrill ( lanai chapman ) is erudite  conservative and more than a little bit wary of this stranger trying to jump into her life .  thrown together  it becomes clear that both women share a fierce competitive nature .  owen templeton ( cuba gooding jr . ) is currently the most hated man in america .  an nfl referee  he cost gamblers all over the country enormous amounts of money by blowing a call in a high-profile game .  after escaping from a vengeful cab driver  owen gets to new mexico by masquerading as the driver for a busload of lucy ricardo impersonators heading to a convention .  mr . pollini ( rowan atkinson ) is a cheerful  odd little italian man on holiday in america .  he also is narcoleptic and falls asleep at the most inopportune times .  pollini hitches a ride with zack ( wayne knight )  a hyper-tense ambulance driver carrying a human heart across country for a transplant operation .  randy pear ( jon lovitz ) promised his wife beverly ( kathy najimy ) and two kids a fun-filled vacation in las vegas .  fearful that beverly will be angry over his involvement in the race  he claims that he must travel to silver city for a job interview .  beverly insists the family stay together  so they hop in the mini-van and tear off into the desert .  brothers duane ( seth green ) and blaine ( vince vieluf ) cody are young  crooked and stupid .  blaine has a speech impediment due to his poorly self-done tongue piercing  and duane is the only person who can come close to understanding him .  the boys will stop at nothing to reach their goal .  finally  nick shaffer ( breckin meyer ) is a no-nonsense lawyer-in-training who recruits helicopter pilot tracy faucet ( amy smart ) for the journey .  at first glance  they seem blandly wholesome  but all that changes when tracy buzzes the home of her boyfriend shawn ( dean cain ) and spies him swimming with another woman .  director jerry zucker (  airplane    ghost  ) leaps from racer to racer  periodically returning to las vegas where sinclair and mr . grisham ( dave thomas )  his personality-impaired right hand man  continue cooking up bizarre bets for the gamblers .  as with any zucker production  a few jokes fall flat  but the momentum of the comedy zooms past those missteps .  high points for me include a bit involving kathy bates as a roadside squirrel salesperson and an intricately set up gag that carries jon lovitz and family from a bizarre museum to an outdoor rally  with an utterly tasteless and screamingly funny pay-off .  had i been part of the filmmaking team  i would have ditched a joke where a key is dropped into a babys clothes and instead had the key get lost in the cleavage of a dozing society matron .  it would have drawn the same laugh without the squirm-inducing hint of child molestation .  i also would have selected a different band for a concert sequence .  my god  do we really need yet another movie with smash mouth performing  all star ?   but enough carping .    rat race  is a riot  with terrific no-holds-barred performances from the diverse cast .  see it  see it again and when the dvd comes out  buy it  because a movie this hilarious will surely have outtakes to die for .  , POSive noticed something lately that ive never thought of before .  pseudo- substance - hollywood faking deep meanings in their films .  have you ever seen a movie that you really enjoyed  then when you look back  you realize there was something missing ?  more and more  filmmakers seem to be putting out well rehearsed  melodramatic films that evoke strong connotations of being a great film  but if you step aside and reflect on your movie going experience  you may just discover nothing more than elegantly presented fluff .  im not trying to say city of angels is that bad .  it had a lot going for it  but somewhere along the way  it faltered .  somehow  underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all  there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography .  the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment .  but for over an hour  city of angels is well worth the time .  nicolas cage is seth  a guardian angel who  like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels  spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .  meg ryan  in her most subdued performance yet  plays maggie  a doctor who begins to ponder exactly who it is were fighting against when we fight to keep someone alive .  after losing a patient on the surgery table  these questions envelope maggie  and seth  the angel who was there to oversee the patients transition into the afterlife  is immediately captivated by the doctor .  he begins following and observing maggie  falling more and more in love with her everyday .  angels  who we quickly learn are not and never were humans  can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch  but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .  seths adoration is too much to resist  and eventually he does appear to maggie  quite regularly  although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .  the angels are interestingly presented  all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities  but its a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .  cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off  raising arizona  and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .  its nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .  the two arent very comparable to each other  but they both deviate from her usual  intelligently ditzy  romantic comedy roles  and its an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .  but even though the two leads do an impressive job  it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye .  its a shame that with so much going for it  city of angels falters so much in its final stages  leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there  they just didnt know quite how to get to it .  they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .  filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on  remember  and convey to others thru word of mouth  so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece  they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .  based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title  of course )  city of angels is ninety percent success  enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings  even the devastatingly disappointing ending .  most movie goers  the non-cynics anyway  will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized .  nonetheless  city of angels is beautifully captivating  which is probably enough to satisfy those poetic viewers who will appreciate a delve into rich emotional territories .  , POSsynopsis : bobby garfield ( yelchin ) lives in a small town with his mirthless widowed mother ( hope davis ) .  bobbys world revolves around his friends  especially the spritely carol ( boorem ) .  then one day  a new boarder arrives at bobbys house .  ted brautigan ( hopkins ) is an enigmatic man to whom bobby takes an immediate liking .  as the bond between bobby and ted deepens  bobby becomes privy to teds great secret  an event which will change both of their lives forever .  review : a small but enchanting movie   hearts in atlantis  easily recalls another king-inspired coming-of-age film   stand by me   both in terms of its setting and the sentiment it conveys .    hearts  is a tribute to the magic of childhood  to those summers when the days seem neverending  and nothing means more than your closest friends .  unlike  stand by me   there is a supernatural element to  hearts   but although it is key to the plot  it is not prominent .  like  stand by me   this is a mostly character-driven film  and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting .  yelchin is very good as bobby  finding a good mix of innocence and resignation .  more splendid still is boorem  whom i praised highly for her work in  along came a spider  and who is simply radiant here as carol .  and then there is hopkins  who despite playing such a quiet  introspective character as ted  nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen .  less successful is davis  whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish .  i also found it odd that bobby and carols other friend  sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movies flashback framing device )  is paid virtually no attention .  but hicks direction is lovely without being cloying  and despite the movies general lack of incident  it never ceases to weave its spell over the audience .  , POSsynopsis : in this movie  steven spielberg  one of todays finest directors  attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .  cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders  but since the americans dont speak cinques language  the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves .  technically  since the international slave trade was outlawed at that time  people like cinque couldnt be kidnapped into slavery ; one had to be born a slave to be legally considered a slave .  lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery  rather than born slaves  in order to get them out of prison as free men .  three lengthy court cases are portrayed with spielbergs trademark panache - - flashy beginning  lots of facial close-ups  big music  and dramatic imagery .  a final speech by adams is followed by an anticlimax where subtitles show what eventually happened to the various characters .  opinion : making a fictional movie is easier than making one about real life .  in fiction  one invents purposeful  clear-cut good guys and bad guys  puts the fictional characters in conflict  and takes the tale to its exciting conclusion .  real life  however  consists of long stretches of boredom with a few dramatic moments and characters who stand around  think thoughts and do nothing  or come and go before events are resolved .  spielberg gives us a visually spicy and historically accurate real life story .  djimon hounsou and anthony hopkins turn in excellent performances .  , POSthe police negotiator is the person with the entirely unenviable job of going into ground zero and attempting to talk a dangerous criminal out of doing whatever he or she intends to do .  lives are often at stake  and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable  prone to turn on the negotiator at a moments notice .  the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor  psychologist  and sham artist  in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence  or failing that  must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .  most of all  the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible  and quickly gain control of the situation  dominate the conversation  and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants .  it takes a pretty smart person to do that .  but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ?  what if hes also able to think on his feet ?  in fact  what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?  it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary grays the negotiator .  in this film  police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .  when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in romans home  roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .  faced with the scorn of most of the police department  and under close scrutiny by the media  roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captains office .  i dont quite remember if the captain actually said   i hate to do this  but . . .    although it wouldnt surprise me if he did .  luckily  the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .  after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney  roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t .  walsh )  taking him and others hostage  and proclaiming he has been framed .  although romans actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up  gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue .  jackson  while a superb actor  is miscast in the role of roman .  the actor has become so popular  and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found  such as in jackie brown )  that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats .  the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .  how can we believe hes going to shoot a hostage  no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?  unfortunately  this preconception saps the film of some of its would-be suspenseful moments  and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jacksons acting ability .  almost every time hes in a scene  jackson steals it without looking back .  when spacey appears  the film has already run about a third of its course .  his is an interesting character .  made out to be some kind of negotiating superman  our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .    i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower  but i cant talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone   he says .  when he gets the call to action  however  he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be .  soon  his character has to negotiate not only with roman  but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out  all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation  should negotiations fail .  this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .  as the second protagonist  spacey measures up nicely .  gray really lucked out with this cast .  david morse as commander beck  ron rifkin as commander frost  and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent  and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .  the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock  rifkin played the d . a .  in l . a . confidential  and spencer played a police detective in cop land .  with the level of acting  however  this can be forgiven .  also in the supporting cast  paul giamatti as rudy  one of the hostages  is notable for the comic relief he provides .  his character is initially so slimy  and giamatti himself just looks so shifty  that you expect to laugh before he even says anything .  fortunately  this doesnt distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film  but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout .  j . t . walsh  as the suspicious internal affairs inspector  clocks in with one of his final performances .  sadly  the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year  and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .  walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam  backdraft  and nixon .  for one of his best performances  check out sling blade  in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .  when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march  walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .  the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh  and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role  it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing .  in the end  the negotiator has a plotline that parallels its reality .  were served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .  as an audience  were also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie  and wed like to see if one will dominate the film .  both provide some pretty good entertainment .  , POSplot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon  to whom hes devoted a tribute band in which he sings  gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place .  critique : im a sucker for movies like this .  a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams  works hard  devotes the time  the energy and the patience  and ultimately hits it big-time .  in the case of this film  our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup  luck always finds its way into these types of equations  although generally tied very closely to hard work )  they need a new singer .  his entry and adaptation to the whole  rock n roll  lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch .  although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it .  metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isnt that prominent anymore  i still check out my motley crue  twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again .  thats not to say that you wont like this film if you dont like the music  but the music and live performances from the band  play a big part in the movie  and i for one  had a blast watching and listening to it all .  but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg .  wow  hand this fella some major props  as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally  metal god was the films original title  and a much better one if you ask me ) .  he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through .  he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic  who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams .  aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet )  but she didnt pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes .  i was also impressed by some of the  real  musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne  jeff pilson from dokken  stephan jenkins from third eye blind  blas elias from slaughter )  but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members .  its to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay  as in this film ) .  just for the record  im certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements  since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies  but because its a fun  uplifting  well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances .  oh yeah  and for those who dig the  heavier  side of music  the soundtrack also rocks ! !  you see . . . dreams  can come true . . .  wheres joblo coming from ?  almost famous ( 8/10 ) - blow ( 8/10 ) - boogie nights ( 9/10 ) - detroit rock city ( 8/10 ) - girlfight ( 6/10 ) - goodfellas ( 10/10 )  , POScarry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion .  made in 1972  it still features most of the regulars of this genre .  sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit  kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting  head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac  hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron  and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode .  the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs  with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard .  this time  williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode .  the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : -  i assure you  that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other !   bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself .  there are great cameos from joan sims  an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene  and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks hes at work ( at the railway station ) .  sid james gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home .  he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him !  the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospitals pills with panic ensuing .  there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron  however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous matrons .  williams is  as usual  on top form  but sid james isnt given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .  the same does not go for charles hawtrey  for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time  he seems to steal every scene he is in .  by not making use of sid james and barbara windsors talent to full effect  the film seems to flounder  but it certainly makes up for it with its good storyline and its other appealing characters .  this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !  , POSthe ultimate match up between good and evil   the untouchables  is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .  based on the 1959 television show of the same title   the untouchables  may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place  but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences  some excellent acting  a memorable score  and a clever script .  the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .  elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .  however  as ness soon learns  in order to stabilize peace  you have to bend a few laws .  the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .  the film begins with capone  played perfectly by deniro  declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .  the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capones men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .  from this point we know capone is evil  not only because he kills without hesitation  but also because he is a lying bastard .  right from the first five minutes of the film  de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .  this developed hatred is before the films hero  ness  is even introduced .  i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .  the film only gets better from this point .  with the formation of the untouchables  there is a group of men wearing long  dark overcoats and hats .  they walk in unison and they only look forward .  as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .  holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals  this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .  one that comes to mind is  the matrix  when neo  morpheus  trinity  and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .  wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930s style  the similarities between these two are countless .    the untouchables  has some of the hippest  bravest heroes in any action film .  the four members were the only ones willing to go against capones army .  each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .  elliot ness  played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner  is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .  he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .  however  as the film develops so does ness .  his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .  he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .  his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .  sean connery  who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role  plays malone  an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .  malone acts as a mentor to ness .  he teaches him  the chicago way  to do things ; when they attack with a knife  you attack with a gun .  connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .  andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone  a young man who is just becoming a police officer .  as ness grows  he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .  charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .  smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .  the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .  also very similar to  the matrix   they are exciting and intense .  >from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps  the scenes are well thought out and well executed .  the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .  its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .  the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .  although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified  this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting  great directing  and great action .  some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat  the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .  , POShaving not seen   who framed roger rabbit  in over 10 years  and not remembering much besides that i liked it then  i decided to rent it recently .  watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .  aside from the fact that its a milestone in animation in movies ( its the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters  have them interact  and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment its also quite an effective comedy/mystery .  while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original  especially baby herman  and watching them together is a lot of fun .  the story begins in hollywood in 1947 .  cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work  so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k .  maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get rogers mind back on work .  maroon thinks that rogers wife  jessicas  possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots .  valiant takes some photos of jessica playing  `patty cake with marvin acme ( stubby kaye )  the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon .  upon seeing them  roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect .  the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear rogers good name .  along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type whos out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon .   `who framed roger rabbit won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) .  director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production  which included hundreds of animators .  also bob hoskins performance should be credited .  he  in addition to the rest of the human cast  finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars .  according to the internet movie database  hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off .  `who framed roger rabbit is a rare film .  one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) .  do yourself a favor and rent it  `p-p-p-p-please .   , POStheres something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days .  stiller currently

stahl .  theres also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute theyve proved themselves commercially .  ewan mcgregor springs to mind who  after successful turns in  emma  and  brassed off   received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyles transatlantic junk-fest   trainspotting .   the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want em to be taken seriously  make em do drugs .    permanent midnight  is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl  a successful hollywood writer who  in the mid-eighties  had a $5  000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6  000-a-week heroin habit .  a habit  in stahls own words   the size of utah .   as stahl  stiller contributes a commanding performance .  unlike  trainspotting   which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse   permanent midnight  instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .  one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to  naked lunch  author william s . burroughs who  when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds   so i can shave .   stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in  permanent midnight  ; its so he can talk to his mother on the phone  show up for work on time  even pay his bills .  while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl  the writing ( adapted from stahls autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .    permanent midnight  shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the authors words--  escape the drug scene  ( yeah  right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley  so impossibly polite youd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .  stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristowns own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time .  janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith  and thats stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .  stiller  unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes  has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but  to his credit  never once pushes his pill-popping  needle-jabbing performance over the top .  the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see  permanent midnight  ; a dark  comic  and strangely absorbing study of assisted living .  , POSby phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howards ransom .  gibson plays tom mullen  a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath  played by gary sinise ( forrest gump )  and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million .  tom and his wife  kate  played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police  but they contacted the fbi .  minutes later  an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in toms house and wiring every phone .  the plot sounds average  just like most other kidnap movies that youve already seen  and it was nothing more than that .  that is until about half-way through the movie .  suddenly  tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying   this is your ransom .  but this is as close as you will ever get to it .  instead  i am offering this money as a reward on your head  dead or alive .   at this point  the plot thickened  and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .  the last half of the film is very well done .  another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise  as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .  owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject :  it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones .   before this movie  sinise played mostly  good guys   first in of mice & men  then in forrest gump  and most recently  in apollo 13 .  but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad .  gibson  of course  was just being gibson  in an oscar-worthy performance .  although most of the scenes were quite predictable  ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film .     , POSone can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .  the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy  innocent fun .  sometimes the stories are compelling .  sometimes theyre not .  but  with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces )  ive never been bored by any of the enterprises numerous missions .  star trek : insurrection is no exception .  the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks its the worst in the series )  but im not really sure why .  its an exciting  often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .  some say its a bit too light  and more of a long episode than a film .  others say the special effects are cheesy and that its boring .  i simply enjoyed the film .  insurrection  which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast  introduces us to a race of people called the baku ; the baku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old )  but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .  of course  these peaceful people cant horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies  the sona  led by ruafo ( f .  murray abraham )  to mess everything up .  the sona  who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable  strike a deal with the federation to move the baku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .  thats when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the baku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a baku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .  so  with his trusty crew  picard defies the federation to keep the baku in their natural habitat .  when dealing with a series with as much history as this  its not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .  this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it  one has to understand how to approach it .  insurrection  however  does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .  stewart is bold as always  a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .  jonathan frakes  who also directed  is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain  overacting like crazy .  frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film  with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .  this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation  and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes  in which the sona employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the baku planet  the special effects have a clean  impressively sharp look .  if i have any complaint about the film  its that it tries to take a moral stance when its not very appropriate to do so .  i dont think its that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 baku in order to save the lives of thousands .  better yet  why couldnt they have co-existed ?  insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .  with its inherent camp factor  the star trek series doesnt seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .  i prefer to just enjoy the spectacle .  , POSa fully loaded entertainment review - website coming in july !  >from ace ventura to truman burbank  jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic  yet sympathetic  characters .  1996s the cable guy was supposed to be his big  breakthrough  role from zany humor into darker  more dramatic acting .  as most everyone knows  the results were  well  less-than-stellar .  not only did the film not do so hot at the box office  but it was also panned by critics .  as far as i know  gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it .  the first time i saw the cable guy  in theatres  i was in super critic-mode  and didnt really like it .  however  due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day  ive had time to lean back  relax  and take in the film .  and to my surprise  it grew on me .  the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy  played by carrey  then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship .  see  stevens been having some problems with his girlfriend  robin ( leslie mann )  and he doesnt think he has any more room in his life for a new friend .  also  some of the cable guys antics have been creeping him out .  carrey  as the cable guy  gives steven various aliases  which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate  chip douglas  ricky ricardo  etc . he apparently lives in his cable van  and while many critics didnt enjoy this newer  darker  less-manic performance from carrey  i thought it was interesting and rather well-done .  for me  its not the movie as a whole thats enjoyable  but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at stevens apartment  a medieval fight at a theme restaurant  and a bathroom beating ( a la liar  liar )  just to name a few .  perhaps the fact that more of carreys humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny .  and if you really want to see something  youve got to hear his version of jefferson airplanes  somebody to love   sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam .  the cable guy has its bad spots  like most any movie .  i didnt particularly like stevens girlfriend  and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend .  also  the ending  while having you fooled for a moment  is rather contrived  and somewhat dissapointing .  still  i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if youre at the video store and cant think of anything to rent  i suggest you try it out .  or if you have hbo  just wait till it comes on ( you wont have to wait long . )  hell  thats what i do every day .  , POSwhen bulworth ended  i allowed myself a sigh of relief : ? it is possible for me to enjoy political satire . ?  there have been several recent political films that didnt do a whole lot for me -- wag the dog  for instance  i found to be an intelligent but heartless film  while primary colors is unbearable and unwatchable in its awfulness . ?  bulworth is a far better film than these  both in its execution and lasting impression . ?  its a tremendously funny and intelligent picture  but it also has an emotional center -- writer/director/star warren beatty allows the audience to identify with his character  and  in turn  we like him and actually care about the story .   ?  beatty plays incumbent democratic senator jay billington bulworth ; the film opens and we see bulworth sobbing as he watches his television spots over and over again . ?  he hasnt slept in days  nor has he eaten  and  almost instantaneously  he goes insane .   ? hes not stark raving mad ( not outright  anyway )  but hes definitely bonkers .   ? its the final weekend of his campaign  and his assistant  murphy ( oliver platt ) has written him a speech to feed to a group of black people in a church in the ghetto .   ? bulworth begins the speech  but suddenly goes off track and just starts being honest . ?    you mean   one lady asks   the democratic party doesnt care about the african american community ?  ?    well   he shouts  laughing   isnt that obvious ?   the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that its a bad thing to make decisions when youre suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman .   ? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated .   ? suddenly  in the short span of this weekend  bulworths no-nonsense  truth in politics  methods become a national sensation  and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that hes appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences .  beattys work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ?  his script and direction are both extremely sharp  as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ?  here is a man whos reached his limit  and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ?  i like that the film doesnt take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations  but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ?  some of the segments are simply hilarious  such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ?  much of the film is completely absurd  but thats the fun part about it . ?  its an angry  serious film at the core  but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ?  what adds to this feeling is beattys portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale .   ? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- hes always funny  but hes also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions .   ? beatty is so good that bulworth  despite his shortcomings as a human being  is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning .  the supporting cast is vast and colorful . ?  berry is luminous  as always  and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ?  don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ?  oliver platt is an actor who should be careful  for someday i fear he may induce a heart attack with the intensity of his acting ( though hes very funny to watch ) . ? paul sorvino adds the southern accent to his list of mastered inflections .  is bulworth offensive ? ?  i suppose some may see it that way . ?  i wasnt offended by the film  but then again  i hardly care about politics . ?  i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ?  the film isnt perfect  of course -- the ending didnt quite work for me  and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ?  but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ?  bulworth is a smart  uproariously funny picture that proves to me that political satire can scratch far deeper than the surface . ?  , POScall 911 for the cliche police if you must  but the eyes are the window to the soul .  the finest actors working in films are those who can command the screen with a gaze : paul newman  ralph fiennes  anthony hopkins  morgan freeman .  you look at these men on screen and you can tell without them saying a word that there is something going on in their minds  that the characters they play are real human beings .  we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor  but he had that unique quality in his eyes .  in gridlockd  an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire  shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry .  shakur and roth play ezekiel  spoon  whitmore and alexander  stretch  rome  two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio  an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) .  when a new years eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose  spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time .  they soon make a new years resolution to get into rehab  but that proves to be easier said than done .  as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough  spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy  confusion and red tape .  the government might be the least of their obstacles  however  as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer  and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) .  in order for you to buy into gridlockd at all  you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie  they are going to government offices on new years day  in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all .  gridlockd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey  1991s falling down  which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles .  in falling down  michael douglas d-fens ( the characters personalized license plate  echoed in gridlockd by the drug lord d-repers plates ) whips out a gun because he cant get breakfast at mcdonalds ; in gridlockd  spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center .  and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences  writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation .  one bureaucrat responds to a tirade from stretch with the question   do you expect the world to stop . . . just  because you picked _today_ to clean up ?   the world in gridlockd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down  but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time .  hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system  but perhaps not enough of them .  a significant chunk of gridlockd is devoted to spoon and stretchs flight from d-reper and from the police  and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments .  in one scene  stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures .  the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running  while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time .  hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the films main events  perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior .  oh  the irony of it .  tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case  and living the life to back it up .  in gridlockd  shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him .  spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall  but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction .  mostly it comes through those eyes  eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta .  it is spoon who plays conscience to stretchs pure appetite  and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoons goal as any agency or enemy .  gridlockds most cruelly comic scene finds stretch  helping  spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife  and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him .  with friends like that  spoon doesnt need enemies  and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much .  the tragedy now is that we wont get more chances to see those eyes again .  , POShilarious  ultra-low budget comedy from film school dropout kevin smith chronicles a day in the life of two convenience store slackers ( brian ohalloran and jeff anderson ) .  they spend most of their day ignoring customers while discussing everything from fellatio to self-fulfillment .  the premise is strictly sitcom and the photography is grainy as all get-out  but you could spend ten times the films budget ( a reported $27  000 ) and still not get dialogue half as good as this .  originally rated nc-17 for language .  not recommended for viewers with sensitive ears .  killing zoe ===========  remake reservoir dogs as a french art film and youre halfway to killing zoe  writer/director roger avarys slow-moving story of a failed bastille day bank robbery .  eric stoltz stars as an american in paris who gets in * way * over his head when hooks up with a band of nihilistic bank robbers .  hes the safecracker whos blissful unaware that the bank job is a botch job from the word go .  though intriguing on all fronts  the film is paced at half the speed of pulp fiction  which avary co-wrote with quentin tarantino .  in english and french .  the road to wellville =====================  based on the novel by t . coraghessan boyle  the road to wellville doesnt go very far .  bowels  bowels  and more bowels are explored by dr . john harvey kellogg ( a buck-toothed and bespectacled anthony hopkins )  who  in the early 1900s  advocated abstinence  vegetarianism  and frequent defecation .  he also invented the cornflake .  really .  checking-in to kelloggs battle creek sanitarium are matthew broderick and bridget fonda  just two of the many well-known faces in this failed comedy .  leave your laughter at the door and you can marvel at the unfunny antics of john cusack  michael lerner  lara flynn boyle  john neville  and dana carvey .  the art direction is impeccable and some of the early sequences are amusing  but the novelty quickly wears off as writer/director alan parkers tries his darnedness to turn doo-doo into drama .  what he ends up with is something that i cant print here .  phew !  stargate ========  lawrence of arabia meets star wars .  this epic sci-fi film is more sheer spectacle than anything else .  director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on .  the film is overlong  the characters are cardboard  and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history .  that said  theres still plenty to watch here .  sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands  the morphing headdresses  and a surprisingly spunky james spader .  he plays the egyptologist who gets to prove his theory that that  somebody else  built the pyramids .  less interesting are co-stars kurt russell and jaye davidson of crying game fame .  star trek generations =====================  trek fans may be more forgiving  but  for the rest of us  the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best .  the story is interesting  but each scene goes too long .  the cast is earnest  but the direction lacks punch .  and so on .   ( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . )  original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story  though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead  get a life .   remarkably unremarkable .  miracle on 34th street ======================  in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al  maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary .  john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original .  the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesnt work too well  but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle .  his chemistry with children can moisten any eye .  no claus for alarm .  junior ======  arnold schwarzenegger pregnant ?  sure  billy crystal did it before in rabbit test  but the sight of schwarz with a bulging belly is a casting coup comparable to dustin hoffman in tootsie .  what should be nothing more than a one-joke premise actually gets better as it goes along .  director ivan reitman ( dave  twins ) wisely keeps the farce to a minimum  so the first hour moves slower than you might expect .  dont expect too many yuks from danny devito  but you cant beat those early romantic scenes between emma and arnie .  hows * that * for a collision of acting styles ?  , POSfor those of us who werent yet born when the 1960s rock n rolled around  monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies .  from otis redding to jimi hendrix  janis joplin to the mamas and the papas  and jefferson airplane to the who  this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy .  but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending  which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves .  shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock  the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time .  sure  some have painted their faces and smoke joints  but d . a .  pennebaker ( the war room  moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience .  no matter who is watching  it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul .  the excitement starts before the music even begins .  a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer  she replies that she feels lucky to do so .  there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips  leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers  tries to get in touch with dionne warwick .  and when one band is tuning up  a member remarks   finally  a decent sound system !   you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isnt about vanity  its about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it  a two-way street .  this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience .  its impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain .  and while the lyrics to  wild thing  may not be all that complicated  watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love .  even if you dont recognize every band you see on stage  you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats .  the only drawback to the film is the ending  which unfortunately i must reveal .  all the other bands  big names then and still today  got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time .  in contrast  the last band on camera  a wholly forgettable one  gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time .  for a film thats only 78 minutes long  thats too large of a chunk  especially when previous acts are much more stimulating .  all in all  monterey pop is a precious  rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us .  the variety of music  as well as the beautifully shot performances  are easy to become immersed in .  if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular  this is quickly dispelled .  its almost depressing to think that music this moving doesnt get made much anymore .  instead were stuck with * nsync  the backstreet boys  and jennifer lopez  all of whom should have stuck with modeling .  , POSthe most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppolas 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia  which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour  loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler  kinder ages .  martin scorsese  another italoamerican moviemaker  confronted that perspective with his own  more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets  movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .  unfortunately for scorsese  his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppolas influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .  seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime .  this film was goodfellas  epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .  goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story  told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .  the book  as well as the film  chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta )  irish-italian criminal from new york .  at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino )  local mob boss  and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .  after couple of years  together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci )  he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .  three of them spend years as best friends and associates  gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .  wealth  influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco )  who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities  domestic abuse  arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .  but the perfect world of  wiseguys  gradually begins to fall apart - tommys unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence  jimmys reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and  finally  henrys own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .  goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .  scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .  world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .  scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence  hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime  yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .  after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events )  the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths  trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .  scorsese also manages to break viewers moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies  broken homes  human depravity  violence  bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality  but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .  with the use of ironic soundtrack  manipulative shots  characters dialogue or narrators commentary  goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .  even if we dont pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining  we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .  first  we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movies ironic prologue .  then  instead of single narrator  scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .  this multiple points of views  both in terms of narration and various subjective shots  only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .  same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .  nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs  while depression  paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .  but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral  easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .  however  thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .  such scenes  although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings  became very popular among other directors in 1990s .  fragmentary character of the screenplay  which doesnt have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes  gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .  he uses this structure of film to experiment  and most successful of such experiments is hilarious  a day in life  segment near the end of the film .  another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .  the most respectable among them is robert de niro  but his character  who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio  gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .  joe pesci deserved his  oscar  for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy  and his lines  including ad-libs  probably represent the most memorable element of the film .  ray liotta  although equally talented  perhaps doesnt look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .  liottas henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .  liotta  on the other hand  improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .  lorraine bracco is  on the other hand  very effective and believable as karen hill  wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .  paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso  and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave .  as a combination of clever sociological study  black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .  because of this achievement  and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers  this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .  , POS  the blair witch project  was perhaps one of a kind  a unique film that played completely on its own merit  managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses .  its success made a sequel inevitable  but this is not the sequel  i suspect  anyone much wanted .  after the release of  the blair witch project   tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville  in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch .  locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity  selling twig-sculptures  stones and dirt like those in the movie  and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn  shouting   get out of these woods and go home !  there is no goddamned blair witch !  .  jeff ( ) is one of those people  who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage .  after he got released from the mental institution  he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet .  as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods  on the  blair witch hunt  .  among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend  the pregnant tristen  who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called  the blair witch : history or hysteria ?   and kim  who dresses in black and has some psychic powers .  the last member of the crew is erica  a young beautiful witch-wannabe  who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore  saying  the first rule of wicca is  do no harm  because whatever you do will come back to you threefold .   this strange group plunges into the woods  where they begin to argue about their different approaches to the experience .  on the very first night that they decide to spend under the stars amidst the ruins of parrs abandoned house  strange things start happening .  when they wake up their equipment is gone and only the tapes remain .  after a while they discover strange markings on their bodies .  they are somehow lost in time  as it loops uncontrollably back and forth .  they are all haunted by hallucinations and horrible nightmares and soon they can not see the difference between dreams and reality .  the only thing that they are sure of is that they have brought something or someone with them from the woods . .  documentary director joe berlinger (  paradice lost  ) helms  blair witch 2   leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background .  the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach  because instead of trying to cover similar ground  it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand .  but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story  that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue .  in a way  this is a typical hollywood sequel .  more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail .  the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated .  of course in these situations  quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values .  from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest  with carter burwells (  being john malkovich  and  fargo  ) musical score in the background  you realize that with the exception of its title  this film has absolutely nothing to do with  the blair witch project  .    blair witch . .   was filmed by handheld videocameras and nfeatured acting that was mostly based on improvisation .  in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection  creating a completely different atmosphere .  with its graceful cinematography  production design and flashy editing  the film has a very polished look  which is impossible to associate with the first installment .  and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times  he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor .  the key is simplicity .    blair witch project  had a story which was incredibly simple .  that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination .  the film was practically an empty screen  on which we projected our most frightening nightmares .  the effect was incredibly powerful  lasting and entir e everyone  but in a different way .    book of shadows  feels incredibly controlled and restrict .  here  very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and  clever  that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it .  there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with .  this is simply a less artistic film that doesnt have the talent and originality of its predecessor .  it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesnt always succeed .  but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie  which doesnt allow it to destroy the original .  in the end  i cant call it a bad effort .  its less artistic  not so scary and less original  but certainly not bad .  its simply different .  in fact  if you havent seen  the blair witch project   you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between  the blair witch project  and the  scream  -films .  the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism .  but its a common knowledge and experience that  with a few exceptions  every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making .  to me the story of  the blair witch project  seemed completed  but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that  the book of shadows  is certainly assured .  and its already time to look forward to  blair witch 3  .  , POSseen may 31  1999 on home video ( rented ) .  one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own  everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise .  with some films it might be just a secondary issue  but with `dark city what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are  which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie .  theres an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ?  wherein the player takes on the role of a man who cant remember who he is  where he is and how he got there .  the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict .  the premise to this film is not unlike that game  only this time we dont have control over the protagonist .  we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually  its more than just the city  its the whole reality ) that isnt just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman   `blade runner   )  but is so fully developed its almost a different genre completely .  later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell )  but for now he has no idea whats going on other than the fact something is not right .  the fact theres a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious  hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling .  this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre  horrific tone .  the man doesnt know who he is nor where hes going and its interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him .  in fact  this is the way all stories begin since its impossible to know the history of a character  their feelings  values  morals  etc . until after weve observed them for a while .  but in this case  the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization  developing the mood and outlining the story .  eventually  some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police .  we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt )  a quiet  unemotional  soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time .  two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland )  a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be johns doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly )  a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies .  it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film .  he also contacts emma  which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex  mysterious back story .  but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city   which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo .  everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot  its lighting  art direction and overall production design  they dont seem to be able to afford any gratuities .  however  that might also be whats keeping it from reaching its maximum potential .  by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place  so much unlike the real world we know  we come to realize that its all a hoax .  everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction .  but  as the films tagline says  `last night  one of us went off .   for reasons that are never clearly explained  it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning ) .  the aliens  which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin  also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight .  at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made  they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then .  this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard .  he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form .  the aliens mix and match the memories of the citys population to see who will change and who will not .  in the process this creates for a good deal of deep  thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world .  however  where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is .  the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened  yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant  static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly dont help either ) .  for example  john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her  yet in some scenes crucial to the films plot  we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other  which is also part of the films climax and ending .  and thats what proyas seems to be inferring with the film  but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense .  ironically  this is what made his first film `the crow work so well  which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical  dark twisted world .  with `dark city the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message .  still  the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable .  theres a lot to like here  most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does .  the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years .  `dark city is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .  , POSlinda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction  and her being cast as dogmas lead is nothing short of inexplicable .  shes still in fine form as bethany  an abortion clinic worker whos lost her faith .  one night  a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethanys bedroom .  he is metatron ( alan rickman )  the voice of god  and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it .  god would do it him/herself  but he/she is . . . missing  having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again .  bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the  prophets  jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith  doing double-duty )  the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smiths films thus far .  at some point  rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus  the undocumented ( and very black )  thirteenth apostle   and offers his assistance  as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) .  its a wild ride .  theyre in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck  respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been )  who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return .  loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates .  at one point  he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets .  its a nasty  guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks   how corrupt are you ?  .  wings of desire this aint .  since debuting with clerks  smith has grown as a director  particularly in terms of working with actors .   ( chris rock is this films only weak link-between jokes  hes wooden . )  his no-frills visual style hasnt changed much over the years  though ( dogmas widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations )  nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic  hilarious speech after another .  dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely  the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately  but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition .  as well  the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever .  any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly  anyone ? )  and eventually dogmas pacing goes slack .  a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game  in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings  comes at a point when weve heard enough .  because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to lokis bad ) drives the climax  said rant is given a great deal of screen time .  sure  affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior )  but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated .  like tarantino  smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker .  dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies  including indiana jones and the last crusade  with silent bob doing his best harrison ford  and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes !  smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan  catholicism wow !  ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished .  i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions .  proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever .  its a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease  for to read it  one actually has to see dogma .  the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christs  martin scorseses 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis controversial novel  in that it is not directly linked to the pictures content but to rumours and heresy .  theres a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime  just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against .   ( not one of them had watched it . )  every single person refused .  smith and scorsese have a lot in common  and so do the two films in question  because both smiths bethany and scorseses jesus are hollow shells without their faith .  in fact  dogmas denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown thats worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in  a veritable recruitment poster .   ( i felt sentimental about a religion i dont belong to .  now thats powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god  and that spirituality shines through .  its enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins .  my religion is movies .  when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine  in a roundabout way theyre attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid .  i therefore feel that  although im no bible-thumper  im at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers .  , POSyouve heard all the hype .  youve seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala  liam neeson ( schindlers list ) as qui-gon jinn  ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi  and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker .  if youve read any reviews  youve also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy .  you also may have heard that this ones too kiddie-friendly  and doesnt have enough content for adults .  believe the hype .  the effects are stunning  the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic  the lightsaber duels are amazing  and queen amidalas sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth .  but theres something missing here  and it isnt budget or effects - its everything money * cant * buy .  the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters .  the most successful at this is liam neeson who  as qui-gon jinn  a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi  has quiet dignity and a wise  commanding presence .  he is the anchor to this movie  as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out .  portmans queen amidala and mcgregors obi-wan kenobi dont fare nearly so well .  amidala  the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? )  comes off as stoic  stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .  and obi-wan  although mcgregor makes him very endearing  has so little screen time that hes nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinns batman .  however  mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity  and he does a good job .  he also absolutely nails alec guiness ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent  and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise .  in fact  lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit  and thats one of the problems with this film .  i would never call myself a  star wars  fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but ive always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .  however  if you are the one person in america who * hasnt * seen the films at all or even recently  or who doesnt bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters  you may be hopelessly lost .  for example  one of the films main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .  for those of you not recently steeped in  star wars  trivia  emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vaders master in  return of the jedi  and  empire strikes back .   so  obviously  his appearance in  phantom menace  is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series  thus making his role here more meaningful .  a lot of the movie is like that .  r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances  and its obvious that lucas is banking on the audiences pre-existing fondness for them . . .  because he doesnt do much to add to it in any way .  same goes for jabba the hutt  who doesnt look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .  even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up )  coruscant ( the cloud city from  empire strikes back  )  and alderaan ( leias home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in  star wars  ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing .  whats the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?  the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty .  theres no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are  not as they will be .  another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .  i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved  making them look more like muppets than actual characters .  and jar jar binks  a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character  is intended as comic relief  but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .  unlike chewbacca and c-3po  who got their humanity ( if youll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters  jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind  at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive  teenage mutant ninja turtles .   furthermore  the dialogue is often stilted and corny  and sometimes downright infantile  thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .  oddly  this isnt just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids .  well  hes done a good job .  the hero of this film  of course  is young anakin  but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy .  thats not jake lloyds fault  though - he does a good job of being a cute kid  which is apparently all lucas asked of him .  thats another mistake  of course  because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .  warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !  in my opinion  there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakins future evil in the film .  the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks  and theres nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .  he has a doting mother ( pernilla august  making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .  but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isnt all hearts and roses is yodas hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn .  his explanation ?    his future is clouded .    ( warning : major spoiler ahead .  enter at your own risk . )  of course  the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul  a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts  but has turned to the dark side .  this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie  but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber  and his scary facial makeup .  because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force  obi-wan  qui-gons young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom )  must take over the training himself .  so  at the end of the movie  we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice  anakin  darth vader  skywalker .  did this story need to be told ?  i would say no .  but is it a worthwhile movie to see ?  absolutely .  if you dont enter the theater with jedi-size expectations  and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle  then this is your movie .  the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .  the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight .  and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler  happier time .  above all  this is a fun movie .  not deep  not meaningful  and not profound .  but fun .  maybe next time  lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script  and the guy who directed  empire  will direct .  because if lucas does the next one himself  it will be lacking the one thing it needs the most - potential .   : )  , POSas african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell  there is a wonderful  eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film .  the shot has tibbs face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars .  to see these bars blocking his face  we see how separated tibbs is from the rest of the characters in the film .  as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots  no matter how innocent tibbs is  he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin .  the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is  instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous .  this one shot amazes me because it captures a whole theme in a matter of seconds .  it perhaps may be the most powerful image i have seen in a film .    in the heat of the night  was the first and the best of the three films norman jewison directed concerning racism in america .  jewison has a very keen style of displaying various cases of racism as he is neither pedantic nor overly sentimental .  in these three films he does an excellent job creating very detailed equal analyses of characters from the abused to the abusers .  he is also not afraid to tell the absolute truth about how corrupt society was in the past and is in the present .  preceding the very original  a soldiers story  and the recently released  the hurricane    in the heat of the night contains some classic lines and some very memorable characters .  the film  which won best picture in 1967 focuses on vergil tibbs  played superbly by sidney poitier as a fearless african american police officer from philadelphia who refuses to give up on an investigation in a white town where is he not wanted .  tibbs is a man who rarely loses his temper and that is worth mentioning because he is constantly facing abuse from those around him .  as a hero who is not afraid to face off against five men with chains  tibbs is the perfect protagonist .  poitier also gives an excellent  noteworthy voice to his character .  never nervous and always commanding  his speech patterns are very manipulative as they range from stentorian to soothing .  however  unlike  the hurricane  where denzel washington dominated over the rest of the cast  poitier shares the spotlight with rod steiger  who won best actor for his excellent performance .  as a sheriff who helps tibbs and warns him of the dangers around him  steiger shows a great amount of skill in his role .  he starts off as racist and blind as the other townspeople .  he would refer to tibbs as  boy  and would always suspiciously keep an eye on him .  as the film progresses though  there is a very gradual change in the sheriff .  he begins to see the hardships tibbs faces and he sees the foolishness of his own neighbors .  what i really enjoyed about steigers character was that he did not completely abandon his friends or connect with tibbs at the end of the film .  he still could not refer to tibbs as mister tibbs or officer tibbs but rather settled for virgil .  instead  it was apparent that he was eventually going to see the world differently in the future .  most movies would have a character reversing all of his beliefs and influences in a matter of minutes .  this action would not have been realistic at all since it is nearly impossible for someone to believe something one day and believe something else the next day .  jewisons determination to make this film as realistic as possible is very obvious here and also very appropriate .    in the heat of the night  shows the difference between the north and the south or a major city and a small town in the united states during the 1960s .  it displays this perfectly .  however  the actual investigation  although it is not the main focus of the film  lacks interest .  it seemed rushed especially towards the end as if jewison had given his message about racism and did not feel like giving a credible explanation involving the murder victim .  there were way too many characters added during the last fifteen minutes and some of the scenes during this time period were inane ( police officer sam being a suspect was not needed ) .  also  it is given that tibbs is a vigilant homicide detective who is the best at what he does  but some of his discoveries came out of nowhere and how he found out some of the important case details towards the end were never answered .  the rushed ending was the only mistake of this otherwise memorable jewison classic .   ( a congratulations has to be given to actor scott wilson .  he managed to be in the two best movies of 1967   in the heat of the night  and the even better  in cold blood .  )  , POSin wonder boys michael douglas plays an aged writer \ professor with such lived-in naturalism that i believe it may be his best performance .  ever since wall street  douglas has spent the greater part of his career playing variations on the shark in a suit gordon gecko character he personified in the mid-80s .  in those performances he tended to exaggerate the vehemence of cutthroat businessmen  with much frothing at the mouth while projecting all his bad intentions to the world .  youd think such a man would keep his evil wrapped tightly underneath a good-natured veneer  but from gordon gecko to nicholas van orton  douglas played the role straight and out in the open .  in wonder boys his performance isnt showy or a tour de force  its simple yet truthful .  he embodies grady  a craggy old writer with a predilection for pot and pink bathrobes .  grady instructs a writers workshop while working tirelessly on a follow up to the novel that put him on the map .  when we first encounter this curmudgeon in the midst of his workshop  we hear his sardonic narration on the soundtrack as students bombard one of their own with unfair criticisms .  grady points out  in his narration  that they only do so out of jealousy .  their target is the very writerly named james leer ( played by the always understated tobey maguire )  a student full of potential and one whom grady develops a mild affection for .  leer is the kind of youth who seems to mechanically block out emotions .  he speaks in an intellectualized monotone with just a hint of dry wit around the edges .  hes portentous and gloomy  as if modeling himself after the great depressed writers  though his act is a little too calculated .  he reminds me of the self-imposed outcast film director  jim jarmusch ( dead man  ghost dog ) .  whenever i happen to catch jarmusch in an interview i see the man speaking in a toneless manner ( the monotonous drawl supposedly masking depth or contempt for his interviewer )  exclusively dressed in black  and with his spiked hair dyed snow white .  leer is similar  a guy who equates quirks with depth .  tobey maguire fits well in the role .  with his round  sweet-eerie face he resembles bud cort from harold and maude .  but unlike cort  maguire is easier to warm up to ; hes a messed up kid reaching for artistic credibility .  katie holmes plays hannah  a beautiful  talented writing student just itching to get in gradys pants .  this is a plot line i had trouble with .  douglas  in his old age  is beginning to resemble jerry springer  a man who has actually paid for sex on numerous documented occasions .  at first i found it extremely difficult to believe that someone as beautiful as hannah would desire grady ( maybe its because im jealous  and wish holmes was throwing herself at me  after all i may just be a lowly internet critic but at least i still have all my teeth )  then i think of douglass real life companion  the breathtaking catherine zeta jones .  seeing those two together looks a lot like a kidnapping .  suddenly my mind has shifted from the task at hand ( that being reviewing this completely wonderful movie ) and im pontificating on why the hell jones would desire douglas .  there is a movie in there somewhere .  grady  rather chivalrously if you ask me  resists the charms of hannah for sara gaskell ( a droll frances mcdormand )  who is his age  but also married to another professor .  okay  maybe not so chivalrous .  there is a great line in the film spoken by douglas about sara where he says   she was a junkie for the printed word .  lucky for me i manufactured her drug of choice  .  robert downy j . r plays a bisexual editor who makes his entrance with a towering transvestite on his arm .  downy has mastered the gleefully dry hyper articulate wit of many a hipster intellectual .  hes arrogant but completely likeable in his utter arrogance .  the actor is perfectly cast here  and remains a joyous movie presence somewhere between a typical tom hanksian comic leading man and edgy character actor .  i wish wonder boys had more of him .  searching for a plot among the elements of wonder boys would be pointless  for it meanders through its running time  but thats part of its charm .  and maybe im a bit biased towards the film because it takes place in a haven of literary academia  a place im greatly fond of  and a place rarely explored in american cinema .  everyone has a sub-genre ( be it war films  westerns  dance movies ) that they happen to be privy to .  im privy to films about literary types i . e .  those individuals enthralled by the written word  and if you are not so inclined it may be wise to knock my above grade down about half a notch .  the direction by curtis hanson is more akin to a european film with its leisurely pace and situations that grow from the characters  rather than generic mapped out story points .  sometimes the dialogue is too clever  but thats a problem i wish i found with films more often .  another minor quibble is that early on the film seems a bit too introverted  like its characters  but as the story progresses it begins to open up .  for me wonder boys works as subtle drama because of its insight into artistic types  and as a low-key comedy for its chuckle-worthy throwaway gags .  the gags are like those in the great robert altman ( m * a * s * h  the long goodbye ) movies  where jokes exist as asides on the fringes  like jokes in life often do .  the broader comedy such as the killing of a blind dog  and incessant smoking of marijuana isnt ineffective but not nearly as memorable as the little things .  curtis hanson  who before his last film  la confidential  toiled about with exploitation fare like losin it ( an early tom cruise sex comedy ) and the hand the rocks the cradle  has graduated to more meaningful films .  he directs wonder boys in an appropriately dour style  the comedy coming from the false gloom his characters put up .  the morose crooning of leonard cohen would seem an odd song for the background of any party  but in a wonder boys party  it fits .  the film is like a piece of literature put up on the big screen .  its the cinematic equivalent to a good read  novelistic in its approach with themes rarely found in american movies .  many will find it slight  but i found much to savor among its subtleties .  , POSplot : derek zoolander is a male model .  he is also very dumb and impressionable .  for that reason  he is secretly hired and trained ( so secret  that even he doesnt know about it ) by an underground fashion syndicate to assassinate the prime minister of malaysia  who wants to abolish child labor in his country .  will zoolander fulfill the dirty deed ?  will zoolander ever grace the world his new  look  ?  is this a funny movie ?  find out below . . .  critique : theres a place in our world for  stupid comedies  .  films which dont pretend to take themselves seriously  are based on idiotic premises and filled with dumb jokes .  theres also a time for them and many would argue that this difficult period of our history  might be an ideal circumstance during which to  relax  by watching something so completely frivolous .  well  if youre in the mood for some seriously mindless entertainment  ben stiller and his cast of many have assembled one of the more original dumb comedies in some time .  of course  comedies as such are usually very subjective and i could see how some will see this film simply as stupid and unfunny  while others will grant them the  stupid   but consider it funny instead .  i personally enjoyed it for the most part  cracked up loudly during a couple of specific sequences and loved the derek zoolander character and the unrestrained whipping they released upon the fashion industry .  snap !  it was also nice to see several real-life models with small roles in the movie  not taking themselves too seriously .  and if youre the type of person who likes celebrity cameos in films  well  dont look any further because dozens of famous faces show up here including vince vaughn  billy zane  winona ryder  christian slater  david duchovny  natalie portman and many  many others .  i especially liked andy dicks complete make-over as the masseuse .  hi-larious !  but with all films of this type  there is bound to be some stuff that simply doesnt work .  a few particulars which didnt strike my fancy included the bulimia and  orgy  sequence with christine taylor  the break-dance fighting  and i also never get why they use real countries in plots like this ( why not just  make up  a country  instead of zeroing in on a certain people ? ) .  i also could have done with less of the taylor character in general  since she wasnt all that interesting and seemed to slow things down every now and then ( more zoolander  dude ! ) .  but those few missteps were nothing compared to some of the more memorable scenes which definitely did work for me !  i almost pissed myself during the  gas station  disaster  absolutely adored the  walk-off  contest ( with david bowie as the judge  no less ) and appreciated many of zoolanders moronic one-liners (  i was a merman . . . a  merman ! !  ) .  and i dare you to get his  monkey  photo shoot out of your head after seeing this movie (  youre a monkey  derek . . . a  monkey !  )  i also really liked the soundtrack and the pace of the film  both of which zipped and zagged  and established a nice rhythm to it all .  again  its to note that this movie is dumb and not for everyone  but my guess is that if you laughed at the trailer  you will likely enjoy many of the quips in the actual picture as well .  if you thought the trailer was dumb  skip this dodo bird and go rent austin powers again or something  a film from which there is an obvious influence here .  blue steel  baby . . . yeah ! ! !  wheres joblo coming from ?  austin powers ( 7/10 ) - austin powers

so ( 3/10 )  , POSunzipped is a cinematic portrait of isaac mizrahi  an artist whose palette is fabric .  ostensibly  the film is a documentary  but use of that term requires stretching its meaning .  many scenes appear staged  and a great deal of cutting-and-pasting has been done in the editing room .  the cinema verite effect is a conceit -- genuine spontaneity is at a premium  and everyone is aware of and playing to the camera ( especially would-be actresses like cindy crawford ) .  director douglas keeve ( who was mizrahis lover at the time ) freely admits that he  couldnt care less about the truth  but was more interested in capturing  the spirit and love in isaac and in fashion .   despite violating nearly every rule of  legitimate  documentary film making  however  unzipped is a remarkably enjoyable piece of entertainment .  while it sheds only a little light on the behind-the-scenes world of the fashion industry  it presents a fascinating  if incomplete  picture of designer mizrahi .  this man is the perfect subject for this kind of study -- hes funny  energetic  and eminently quotable .  he has unusual views on just about everything  from fashion (  its about women not wanting to look like cows  ) to mary tyler moore (  between her and jackie kennedy  they shaped this country  ) to style (  its almost impossible to have style nowadays without the right dogs  ) .  unzipped also gives a glimpse into the creative process by which mizrahi turns an idea into a dress .  its almost certainly different that anyone would imagine .  the designer draws on a variety of sources for his look  including nanook of the north and old bette davis movies  then enlists the aid of a ouija board to help form the collection .  in particular  unzipped traces mizrahis development of his fall 1994 line from its inception in the spring to the final fashion show  which highlights a number of prominent models  including cindy crawford  naomi campbell  kate bush  and linda evangelista .  on the technical side  a number of interesting choices were made in filming unzipped .  a variety of film stocks were used : super 8  16 mm black-and-white  and 35 mm color .  there is a purpose to this beyond simple artiness -- the stock often serves as an emotional key to the movie  and  during the climactic fashion show  color is used to show the audiences perspective  while black-and-white is for the behind-the- scenes sequences .  nevertheless  some viewers will be put off by this treatment .  while unzipped isnt an expose on the fashion industry per se  keeve has enough clips of petulant models to make the viewer realize how tame robert altman was with ready to wear .  overall  however  this movie is far more about mizrahi than anything else  and only when viewed from that perspective does unzipped succeed .  when the designer declares that  everything is frustrating except designing clothes -- thats beautiful and liberating   it fits perfectly with the image of him that unzipped has constructed .  , POSdora ( fernanda montenegro ) sits behind a make-shift desk at rio+s major train station .  she  in her colorful demeanor  offers a service that is unheard of in the states .  she writes letters for the illiterate  who pass through  to try to find lost relatives  find love  or search after lost debts .  she+s quirky  she+s elderly  she+s caring .  totally trustworthy  right ?  not a chance .  once home  she never sends these letters  saving money on postage  and relishing in the drama contained therein with her neighbor irene ( mar ? lia p ? ra ) .  one of the letters is sent by a young mother with her nine-year old son  looking for their father .  shortly thereafter  she gets hit by a bus  and the son is orphaned .  days go by  and the boy  named josu ?  roams around the station  hungry  desperate  and somewhat clueless to his predictament .  through a series of circumstances too precious to elaborate upon  dora somehow takes a responsibility in trying to find josu ? +s father .  this means leaving the security of rio  traveling to the outskirts of brazil  where unpaved roads  religious devotees and the poverty-stricken become commonplace .  films like this remind me as to what i enjoy about some foreign films .  it is an opportunity for me to get a fresh breath in another part of the world  so distant from my own .  it does so entertainingly  and so heart-wrenchingly .  and yet  it+s backdrop is merely that .  the focus is on the minute transformation of dora  of how she learns to love this little kid  without being cloying or sentimental .  the most interesting backdrop is the amount of religious dedication is in the film .  dora being an amoral scam-artist  could care less about the amount of bickering between the candle-lighting of the catholics versus the bumper-sticker mentality of the evangelicals .  but neither side is trivialized .  she even begins to develop an affection for a non-drinking evangelical  who sees the problems with dora  if not initially .  fernanda montenegro surprisingly got an oscar nomination for this very delicate performance  but the true marvel is that of vinicius de oliveira  who plays josu ? .  he  like the discoveries of j ? r ? mie renier ( _la promesse_ ) and giorgio cantarini ( _life is beautiful_ )  prove that the true acting discoveries may be outside of the united states .  he is a natural  and never once grating .  send a memo to jonathan taylor thomas .  , POSthe event of events is upon us .  people have waited twenty-two years for the prequel to star wars and die-hard fans have been camping out at theaters for months to get tickets to see it .  i dont think that america will ever actually recover from what this hurricane of a film has caused .  it is not a bit of an exaggeration to say that this is the most highly anticipated movie in history .  anyone who tells you  its just a movie  is either lying or clueless .  it is clearly obvious that after the waiting and the hype actually seeing the movie will be anticlimactic .  the second coming of the lord could not live up to the kind of buzz ( which is far too weak a word ) that star wars epsode i : the phantom menace so effortlessly generated .  but that does not mean that the film itself is bad .  in fact  it is terrific .  i strongly suspect that many of the people who were dissappointed by it have simply surrendered to the media machine and the inevitable backlash .  it is set some decades before the events of the original 1977 star wars took place .  the film focuses on the fledgling republic of planets and the conflict that is raging : the trade federation  angry at some tax raise that was recently put in place has invaded the small  peaceful planet of naboo .  the republic sent two jedi knights ( people that can actively communicate with what is affectionately known as  the force  )  qui-gon jinn ( liam neeson ) and obi-wan kenobi ( ewan mcgregor ) to negotiate .  unable to stop the tide of events that was about to occur  the jedi and the queen of naboo ( natalie portman ) escape naboo and head for coruscant to try and get the republic senate to intervene .  on the way they get sidetracked to a planet called tatooine  where they meet the movies real focal point  young anakin skywalker ( jake lloyd ) .  he is an innocent slave boy  but  the force is strong with him  so qui- gon is determined to take him with them to the jedi counsel and get him trained as a jedi .  as any self-respecting star wars fan should know  anakin will grow up to be darth vader and give birth to luke skywalker .  >from the beginning it is evident that this is not an actors movie .  around 70% of the characters  if not more  are computer generated in one form or another  and though the effects are seamless  the movie lacks soul .  i think that although the computer has played an incredibly instrumental part in moviemaking this decade  cinema should still be a human art and the phantom menace nearly defies this .  this is the lightest installment in the star wars saga thus far  with plenty of broad comic relief to go around  much of it courtesy of an irritating knew character named jar-jar binks .  hes essentially a computer-animated sidekick who says things like  exqueeze me ?   and  mesa go now  okeday ?   and although it is often amusing it is also inherently annoying .  the visual effects are astounding ( although director george lucas often chickens out by cutting away from them ) and the movie is a thrilling triumph .  if it lacks in plot and in acting it makes up for it through imagination and excitement .  the climactic lightsaber battle ( oh  come on  as if you didnt already know )  among other things  is outrageously entertaining and defines the term  popcorn movie  .  what made me surrender and give this movie * * * 1/2 stars was the score by john williams .  even though it does seem like the man scores every single movie that comes out these days  his work here is nothing short of brilliant .  his use of opera during the climax really does add a punch and his ingenious way of utilizing the imperial march as a sort of prophecy is chilling .  the phantom menace is probably most effective as pop nostalgia .  when you see  a long time ago  in a galaxy far  far away   when the familiar music plays  when the words  star wars  appear on screen  youll feel a tingle even if you didnt see the movie when it first came out in 77 .  it feels oddly exciting to be introduced to young anakin  a boy whose innocence  we know  will be taken away and who will soon cross over to the dark side .  it is the perfect example of dramatic irony to see the jedi masters aspire to get him trained in the jedi arts ; we know that it will do more harm than good  but they do not .  we not only feel more involved in the story  but we feel like were seeing the beginning of a saga that we have cherished for years .  the phantom menace  although lacking in human aspects of the story  is a very worthy installment in the star wars .  it works as an action flick  visually eye-popping and often paralyzingly exciting ; it also works as an elicitor of memories  a piece of exquisite nostalgia .   ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  , POSsometimes a movie comes along that falls somewhat askew of the rest .  some people call it  original  or  artsy  or  abstract  .  some people simply call it  trash  .  a life less ordinary is sure to bring about mixed feelings .  definitely a generation-x aimed movie  a life less ordinary has everything from claymation to profane angels to a karaoke-based musical dream sequence .  whew !  anyone in their 30s or above is probably not going to grasp what can be enjoyed about this film .  its somewhat silly  its somewhat outrageous  and its definitely not your typical romance story  but for the right audience  it works .  a lot of hype has been surrounding this film due to the fact that it comes to us from the same team that brought us trainspotting .  well sorry folks  but i havent seen trainspotting so i cant really compare .  whether that works in this films favor or not is beyond me .  but i do know this : ewan mcgregor  whom i had never had the pleasure of watching  definitely charmed me .  he was great !  cameron diazs character was uneven and a bit hard to grasp .  the audience may find it difficult to care about her  thus discouraging the hopes of seeing her unite with mcgregor after we are immediately sucked into caring about and identifying with him .  misguided ?  you bet .  loveable ?  you bet .  a life less ordinary was a delight and even had a bonus for me when i realized it was filmed in my hometown of salt lake city  utah .  this was just one more thing i didnt know about this movie when i sat down with a five dollar order of nachos and a three dollar coke .  maybe not knowing the premise behind this film made for a pleasant surprise  but i think even if i had known  i would have been just as happy .  a life less ordinary is quirky  eccentric  and downright charming !  not for everyone  but a definite change of pace for your typical night at the movies .  , POSthat thing you do !   ( r ) tom hankss screenwriting and directorial debut  that thing you do !  has all the qualities you would associate with the most beloved screen actor of the moment : fun  lively  and oh-so-nice .  it is the latter quality  however  that becomes a hindrance  for this 60s nostalgia trifle is so nice and sweet that it teeters on becoming bland milquetoast .  that thing focuses on the wonders  a teen rock band from erie  pennsylvania that is suddenly thrust into the national spotlight in 1964 when they score a major dance hit called  of course   that thing you do !   the groups members are  naturally a diverse group : theres brooding lead singer and songwriter jimmy ( johnathon schaech ) ; girl-crazy lenny ( steve zahn )  the lead guitarist ; a goofy  geeky type known only as the bass player ( ethan embry ) ; and the films center  guy ( tom everett scott )  the drummer who has aspirations in jazz .  along for the wonders ride to success is jimmys perpetually neglected galpal  faye ( liv tyler ) .  hanks proves to be a capable writer-director  deftly recreating the innocent spirit of 1964  which hanks calls  the last innocent year .   the spirit is not only reflected in the period clothes and settings but also in the music  which  like the other recent period music film  grace of my heart  was expressly written for the film ; hanks himself had a hand in writing four of the tunes--but not the infectious title cut by adam schlesinger  which is guaranteed to stay in your head long after the end credits have rolled ( its still playing in my mind as i write this ) .  it should come as no surprise that hanks the director works well with the actors  eliciting charming  likable work from the entire cast  most notably hanks lookalike scott and tyler  who is remarkable in delivering the films biggest and best dramatic moment .  the work of the young ensemble is so natural that they truly convince as teens of the early 60s ; they do not appear to be 90s grungers playacting  retro .   yet for all the light  frothy charms of that thing you do !  its nearly nice to a fault .  while this unbridled innocence in film is a refreshing change from all the sinful cinema around these days  there is not enough conflict to keep things consistently interesting .  everyone is so happy  basking in the glow of overnight success  marvelling at it all--except toward the end  but even then the tone quickly reverts to sweetness  ending on an appropriately feel-good note .  there isnt much of an edge throughout that thing--the only thing that is remotely edgy is hankss turn as the wonders manager--and thus becomes in danger of being so nice its bland .  but a little niceness goes a long way these days  and theres no denying the entertainment value of that thing you do ! ; its just about impossible to hate .  its an inoffensive  enjoyable piece of nostalgia that is sure to leave audiences smiling and humming  if not singing   that thing you do !  --quite  possibly for days .  to paraphrase a passage from the song : though i try and try to forget that song it is just so hard to do every time they play  that thing you do !   , POS  hes back  and its about time .   was the motto for this television series pilot ( i call it a pilot  i dont care what fox network says ) revival of the cult classic british tv show  doctor who  that spawned no series  which means there are no smart network execs out there ( not exactly news to a lot of people  i know ) .  the motto was well chosen .  the series was simple  it was about this time lord scientist called the doctor with thirteen lives who traveled around in a type forty spaceship called a tardis outsmarting all kind of alien baddies  including the evil daleks  and the master  who appears in this feature  played very badly by eric roberts .  as good as this revival was  there is something missing from it to make sure it was really doctor who .  is it the acting ?  hell  no !  paul mcgann is just as good as any of the other seven guys whove played the doctor ( including his predecessor and off-screen friend sylvester mccoy  who appears once more for the regeneration scene ) .  he looks right for the role  is a brilliant actor  and slips effortlessly into the role  the way my two favorites jon pertwee and tom baker would .  daphne ashbrook brings class to her role as dr . grace holloway  the doctors first companion that he kisses on screen  she is not your typical female companion who screams  and spends her free time making coffee for the doctor  she is a tough  spunky american  and ashbrook shows this well .  young yee jee tso shows promise as chang lee  and ive seen him in other stuff in which he usually plays the punk kid who dies at the end ( this film included )  which  imho  wastes his talent .  the only problem with the acting is eric roberts .  one time he had to say to mcganns doctor   i always dress for the occasion .   but he broke it up  and said it so slowly that it wounded up sounding like a song lyric   i always . . .  dress . . .  for the occasion .   you need an actor less slow and less reliant on moving his hands to act  and whos also british  like mcgann is as the doctor .  executive producer phil segal said he was casted because fox insisted on having one american star in the role .  i dunno who thought of casting him  but if theyre reading this : news flash : eric roberts is * not * a star !  he rides on his sisters coattails  and any hit movie he makes has nothing to do with him .  is this problem the kisses to the past ?  they have references to the show so subtle that non fans would not notice them  only whovians would  and theyre good .  is it the script or the movie as a whole ?  the script is a classy piece of work  featuring a master who can spit slime out of his mouth and nice dialogue  and the movie as a whole is one fans will love  and it is a good stand alone viewing for nonfans to enjoy the series .  so what is it ?  simple : no plot .  the master  on his last legs  sends for the doctor to rescue him after the daleks put him on trial on their planet skaro and exterminate him .  the doctor attempts to take his remains back to gallifrey  but they accidentally land in san francisco  1999  december 31  where the master  with young street hood chang lees help  opens the eye of harmony  which will suck the earth through it at midnight if the doctor  with the help of female surgeon  dr . grace holloway  doesnt close it by then .  virtually no plot .  i was told the movie wouldve featured the daleks on screen and started with more of a courtroom drama between the master and the daleks  but a lot of rewriting went on on the set .  that shows how smart people are  as it would have made the movie a hell of a lot more interesting  and that wouldve gotten a four star rating out of me .  , POSdreamworks pictures presents a jinks/ cohen company production kevin spacey annette

introduced to lester burnham ( kevin spacey )  a 42 year old man trapped within his own life .  lester works for an advertising agency .  his growing dissatisfaction with his job is only one of the mid-life crisis he is suffering .  estranged from both his wife and his daughter  lester starts to crack under the stress .  his life becomes nothing more than a series of mastubatory fantasies  and sullen apathy .  carolyn burnham ( annette bening )  is the prototypical career woman/ homemaker .  she carefully tends her rose garden  decorates her home with the best furnishings .  but inside she is desperate .  unsuccessful at her profession as a real estate agent  she drives herself into states of denial and self loathing that only feed her growing resentment towards her family .  the third member of this anti-family is jane burnham ( thora birch )  lester and carolyns daughter .  a young girl going through the typical stages of adolescence  but having to also come to terms with her families growing dysfunction .  this funny ( and frightening ) slice of life is refreshingly simple .  not one character is given less than is needed to identify him or her .  some of the most telling characters are those that serve to highlight other characters .  most notably is barbara fitts ( allison janney )  the almost catatonic wife of retired marine colonel fitts .  she has almost no dialogue  and seems to be either recovering from a stroke or suffering from one .  colonel fitts ( chris cooper ) is an angry and frightened man .  his rage directed almost singularly at his son  ricky ( wes bentley ) who has just moved with his family to the same neighborhood as the burnhams .  in fact they are the next door neighbors .  anymore detail into the personalities of these marvelously diverse characters would deprive one of the many pleasures and surprises to be had in  american beauty  .  alan ball  who was the co-executive producer of the hit tv series  cybil  and creator of the new sitcom  oh grow up   has fashioned one of the most insightful and expertly tuned screenplays to have hit the screen in the past ten years .  not one character in this film rings falsely .  and the depth of personality in each  is achingly honest and insightful .  the plot detailing the last year in the life of a man as he tries to find his own self worth is so resoundingly cliched and at the same time original as to bring to mind such marvelous film work as  the graduate  or  lolita  .  kevin spacey turns in one of this years most pragmatic performances .  his lester burnham is an everyman caught up in the middle of a life that is spiraling into old age .  finally unable to deal with the lost soul that he has become  lester tries to return to his youth .  he quits his job ( actually blackmailing his employer for one years salary )  starts smoking pot  fantasizes about his daughters girlfriend angela ( mena suvari  in a marvelous performance here )  starts working out  and finally takes a job at the local fast food outlet .  mr . spaceys performance is so remarkably subtle and ingenuous  that we can be certain that come oscar ? time  we can be assured to see him name among the five nominees .  annette bening also turns in what may be the best performance of her career .  carolyn burnham is a woman who has become so insecure as to be caught up in maintaining the facade of normalcy .  unable to cope with her growing disillusionment  she forces herself to maintain her demeanor  driving her further and further into desperation  adultery and possibly murder .  ms . bening makes the character of carolyn so compelling as to be identifiable to almost anyone .  the slow and methodical turn from happy home maker to charnel house martha stewart is too frightening to express in words .  thora birch holds her own against the talents cast with her .  jane burnham is both an innocent girl caught up in what is a dysfunctional family  and a rebellious child ready to abandon them at any moment .  her growing distrust and isolation from her family is something that many parents should view as a warning .  she is the prototypical trophy child .  when carolyn praises her daughter after a performance by her cheerleading team (  im so proud of you  honey .  you didnt screw up once !  )  the bitterness and resentment are palpable .  thora birch is a young actress to watch .  praise must also go to chris cooper who brings yet another angry father role to life with depth and resonance .  colonel finn is a man in complete denial .  his military upbringing masking a desire he is too repulsed to even comprehend .  wes bentley as ricky finn is fine as the enigma .  the boy next door who may be more foe than friend .  a deceitful and calculating young man  whose voyeuristic proclivities mask a deeper and more profound understanding of life than any of the adults around him .  mr . bentleys performance is the one troublesome note in the film .  that is simply because the character is such a grand and complete liar  that one almost faults the performance for it .  director sam mendes handles all of the particulars of the cast and the settings with a sure and composed style that is neither intrusive nor subtle .  scenes of carolyn walking through the rain  carry an ominous fission that calls attention to the emotions of the character .  the subtle cinematography by conrad hall is wonderful  capturing the season in all of its harsh beauty ( fall has never looked so inviting  yet depressing ) .  every nuance of  american beauty  begs its audience to think and examine .  it is a film that will be discussed and debated for years to come .  and well it should  as it is simply one of this years best .  , POSwill

thats not surprising  considering it was written by two actors : damon and co-star ben affleck .  will works whatever kind of job he can get .  first hes a janitor  then he works construction .  off-screen he speed reads books on any academic subject that interests him .  on-screen he hangs out with his friends  picking fights in robust  romanticized-hemingway fashion .  lambeau ( stellan skarsgard from breaking the waves )  a math professor  learns that the janitor ( will ) is a genius with a special talent for advanced mathematics .  having confirmed hes not a fluke or a savant  he does what he can to get will into the education system .  he is firmly rejected .  finally  will lands in jail for one of his fights .  lambeau can get him probation instead of prison time as long as will agrees to therapy sessions and to discussing mathematics with him .  will ( barely ) decides to go for the therapy over prison .  lambeau treats will like a son .  hes proud of  and amazed by  wills accomplishments in mathematics .  he encourages will and tries to give him structure  knowing that  with a little discipline  he could be bigger than einstein .  will isnt really interested in academia .  he knows he would be the best in his field  and therefore spend all of his time in an office  explaining math to people like lambeau .  he would rather work construction  which breaks lambeaus heart .  meanwhile  will attends his mandated therapy sessions .  its not long before he shreds all the therapists on lambeaus  a  list .  will has read enough psychology to know the tricks of the trade  and how to keep them from affecting him .  shrink after shrink refuses to return after wills mockery .  lambeaus last hope is his old college roommate  now a psychology teacher at a small-time community college .  knowing that will is going to try to shred him too  sean ( robin williams ) agrees to take him on as a favor to lambeau and for the chance to meet this next einstein .  true to form  will finds seans emotional weakness and attacks .  but unlike the other shrinks  sean knows what he is in for and continues the sessions .  like a foster mother with a fussy child  sean knows that the attacks are defensive and is able to take them in stride .  like the foster mother  sean knows that time and quiet patience is the only approach .  robin williams is excellent in this role .  hes not an actor with a great range  but in the right roles he has great depth .  in this movie  as in awakenings  there comes a point when the quiet  shy man accomplishes something of great personal importance  and a smile of pure joy spreads up to his eyes .  williams is the only actor i can name who can make an audience cry just by smiling .  i have compared will to a foster child and thats not entirely fair .  emotionally  he has a lot to learn  but he is not a child .  he has thought about his life and made rational decisions about what he wants .  sean  his girlfriend  his pals  and lambeau all help him grow  but he didnt start out asking for  or particularly needing  help .  his exceptional gift singled him out  and those who love him kept pushing him in the right direction .  if i had to say anything bad about good will hunting is that it walks the line between drama and melodrama .  its too sentimental and uplifiting for a straight drama  but the emotions are too subtle for melodrama .  it is emotionally engaging  but its not quite larger than life .  this isnt a problem per se  but at times i didnt know quite how to take it .  but this is a relatively small complaint about a very good movie .  a good movie allows its characters to learn and grow .  it doesnt just happen ; it takes a good script  good acting  and good direction .  good will hunting has all three .  if you are at all inclined to see it  by all means  go .  , POSif theres one thing in common about all of hollywoods major studios  its that their productions are moving toward mainstream more and more .  although twentieth century fox and new line cinema have spawned subsidiaries which specialize in independant or controversial motion pictures ( fox searchlight and fine line respectively )  its obvious theres no significant movement underway to promote inventive ideas at the theater .  so when a movie like gary ross pleasantville comes along  wrapped in a blanket of innovative ideas and served up on a platter of fine production  its a welcome change of pace for all who frequent the cineplexes .  although the atmosphere and buzz about the movie are cheery and lighthearted  pleasantville should not be mistaken for a no-thought movie .  quite the opposite is true  in fact  as director ross skillfully brings a narrative with intense and intelligent undertones to the screen .  the story  both about the joys of living life to the fullest as well as the social ills of segregation  captures the essence of statement-making in the cinema .  not in recent memory has a movie carried such weight of theme into widescale distribution  and even if mass audiences fail to see the ingenuity of ross work  it is still a testament that his picture was considered worthy enough .  kudos to both he and his production staff for putting together this fine picture .  it stars tobey maguire and reese witherspoon as two nineties teenagers who  through quite a bit of luck  find themselves zapped into a fifties sitcom named  pleasantville .   maguire  as the reserved bud parker  is perfect for the pseudo-world ; but the rebellious mary sue ( witherspoon ) is not at all made for the father-knows-best times .  its not long before she sets the town of pleasantville on end  and begins to teach the townspeople - in a quite unlikely way - what life is * really * like .  soon hues of color creep into the black and white world  and while some embrace the change in the passion of realism  others fear the strangeness .  at one end is a soda shop owner-turned-painter named mr . johnson ( jeff daniels ) and at the other end is a close-minded mayor ( j . t .  walsh ) and his chamber of commerce ; but the two sides are simply fronts for a clash of ideas that soon involves the entire town .  fine performances are turned in all around .  maguire and witherspoon are effective as the leads  but the true complements go out to jeff daniels and j . t .  walsh ( in his latest and final posthumous performance ) .  daniels brings an atmosphere of awe  inspiration  and hope to his character  whereas walsh simply drips of sinister closemindedness - almost to the point where you can sense gene hackmans envy .  for daniels  its his most commendable performance of the last three years - or more - and for walsh  its a complementary exclamation point on a fine career .  also of lesser note is the supporting role by joan allen  and in viewing the entire cast works well together from start to finish .  theres not much to dislike about pleasantville  and its dynamic nature makes it the perfect movie for those who want serious as well as those who dont .  , POSwhat do you get when you slap together a movie based on a story by the legendary george lucas  directed by virtuoso director steven spielberg  and starring one of the biggest box-office stars in the world  harrison ford ?  you get one hot-fudge-rockin good time  thats what you get ! ! !  plot : professor/archeologist indiana jones sets out to find the long-lost mystical ark of the covenant before the nazis get their grubby fingers hands on it .  adventures  snakes  romance and mucho action ensues .  critique : astounding movie packed with non-stop action  stunts galore  an interesting story line  great one-liners  a solid cast  a catchy musical score  and all the fun and adventure that you could squeeze into a two-hour thrill ride .  if you dont enjoy this film  then you just dont like action movies  period !  if youre young  youll enjoy its humor  its cool action sequences and its gross-out factor at times .  if youre a little older  youll appreciate the interesting plot line  the romance  and yes  the mountains of adventure .  watching this movie made me feel like a kid again  dreaming and fantasizing about fighting the bad guys  travelling to different countries  making the impossible  possible !  harrison ford is perfect as the every-man with the brains of a scientist and the brawn of an outdoors adventurer  and spielberg manages to achieve the ideal balance of action  fun  adventure and humor .  now if you really want to have a good time  check into this movie on the same night as its two sequels  rent a jug of iced coke  truckloads of nachos and salsa  an adventure hat and whip  and prepare to gag yourself into a world of action-movie heaven !  little known facts about this film and its stars : this picture was nominated for eight 1981 oscar nominations  including best picture .  it lost that award to chariots of fire  but did manage to win for best art direction  best special effects  best film editing and best sound .  actor tom selleck was originally cast as indiana jones  but was committed to his hit tv show   magnum p . i .  .  in filming the well of souls sequence  the producers scoured every pet shop in london and the south of england for every snake they could lay their hands on .  hence there are snakes that are identifiable from many different geographical areas .  however  once all the snakes were on set  it became clear that there were not nearly enough of them  so spielberg had several hoses cut into lengths  and these were used as well .  looking closely  you can tell which are the real snakes and which are not .  an early draft of the script had indy travelling to shanghai to recover a piece of the staff of ra .  during his escape from the museum where it was housed  he sheltered from machine gun fire behind a giant rolling gong .  also in the same script  indy and marion flee the chaos caused by the opening of the ark in a wild mine-cart chase sequence .  both of these scenes were cut from the script  but ended up in 1984s indiana jones and the temple of doom .  this film begins with a shot of a peak in the jungle which is reminiscent of the paramount pictures logo .  the same type of opening is present in its sequels .  jocks airplane at the beginning of the film has the registration number  ob-cpo  .  this is a reference to obi-wan and c-3po from george lucas star wars ( 9 . 5/10 ) .  also  the hieroglyphics in the well of souls include engravings of r2-d2 and c-3po .  they can be seen on a post to the right of indy and sallah as they remove the ark .  the script originally included a long fight between a swordsman and indiana with his whip .  as legend has it  actor harrison ford was suffering diarrhea at the time  and asked if the scene could be shortened .  spielberg said the only way he could shorten it was if indy pulled out his gun and just shot the guy .  the entire crew laughed and thats how it was filmed .  when indy first falls in the well of souls and is face to face with the cobra  you can see the snakes reflection on the glass dividing it and harrison ford  also some fingerprints and stuff like that .  when indy is dragging along the ground  hanging onto the nazi soldiers truck with the ark inside  you can see the pad that hes being dragged on .  , POS`we run tings .  tings dont run we .   -sound advice from capone ( paul campbell ) to his squaddie ( or partner )  floyd ( winston bell ) .  jamaican film  shot entirely on video  featuring a standard cop movie plot mixed with a dash of john woo-styled brotherhood morals ( and a little gunplay ) .  capone  a tough as nails super cop  gets a transfer back to his hometown of kingston after successfully taking down some gangsters that have broken into his home ( while he was with his lady ) and killed his partner in front of him .  when he arrives  he discovers that the ghetto where he grew up has gotten worse  thanks mainly to the crime boss wonie ( jamaican film veteran carl bradshaw )  so named because his left hand has been amputated and replaced by a grasping hook ) .  capone discovers that wonie has been smuggling guns inside shipments of charity supplies for the area churches and  much to his disappointment  also finds out his childhood friend ratty ( mark danvers ) has been helping him .  torn between doing his job and protecting his best friend  capone must make some hard decisions in order to make things right again .  directed deftly by first time jamaican filmmaker chris browne ( assistant director for such american films as how stella got her groove back and instinct )  one hardly notices the film was shot on video after a while .  shots are handled so efficiently that they quickly take on the nuances of the aforementioned john woo films  although the action isnt as hyperkinetic as most of woos films are .  the action scenes are handled with a kind of flair though  and eventually begin to take on a life of their own ( beyond the hong kong films that they are obviously patterned after ) .  the make-up effects are particularly good in these scenes as well  with flawless squib work on display from the effects team .  the cast is superb and listening to their dialogue  spoken with thick jamaican accents ( half of which have to be subtitled because of their extensive use of slang )  just adds to the interest .  paul campbell  as the `loose cannon capone  essays his role perfectly  displaying the right amount of menace and compassion at the right times .  mark danvers evokes sympathy as ratty  the part-time gun smuggler who is also trying to help the community by building football fields and organizing block parties to bring people together .  unfortunately  carl bradshaw is given the least to do and his character as the crime boss seems ineffective ( largely because his underlings seem to run all over him )  but then again  that could be the way his character was intended to be portrayed .  the music in the film is composed of all reggae songs  and the soundtrack was produced by grammy award winning artists  sly and robbie ( who have worked with the likes of the rolling stones  maxi priest  bob dylan  james brown  grace jones  herbie hancock  bootsy collins  and carly simon among others ) .  the end credit song  `we run tings  by the group red dragon  is pretty decent and carries on the theme of the movie established early on by the quote that opens this review .  oddly enough  desmond ballentine ( who plays the character deportee ) is well known as a pioneer in the realm of `gangsta reggae as the performer ninjaman  and he doesnt contribute a single song to the film ( that i could see )  which is virtually unheard of here in the us .  at the time of this writing  third world cop has been put into limited theatrical release in the us  coming off of a six-month box-office breaking run in jamaica  where it holds the position as highest grossing film of all time ( bringing in $21 million in jamaica  which is roughly $500  000 us ) .  palm pictures ( the company that released the offbeat  but entertaining six-string samurai ) is the company releasing the film and considering that their main focus is the dvd market  i can imagine that a disc will be available once the film has left theaters .  chris blackwell  founder of palm pictures  was also involved in the production of another jamaican box-office smash in 1981 entitled countryman  so id say he has a pretty good track record .  overall  third world cop is a pretty entertaining homage to the films of john woo  ringo lam  tsui hark  and many other action films by directors from hong kong .  if action films are your thing and you dont mind intermittent subtitles  then you cant go wrong with this film .  the performances and the story are solid ( if only a little cliched ) and the action is tight .  im not sure what the other jamaican films released in that country are like  but apparently third world cops honors are well deserved .  , POSat first glance  it appears that the home alone movies are brainless slapstick intended for those with minds of 8-year olds .  thats true of home alone 2 and id bet money that its true of home alone 3 ( opening soon ) .  but home alone actually has a lot going for it  and the cartoon slapstick doesnt get in the way .  the mcalisters  all 15 of them  are going to france for the holidays .  four adults and eleven kids are spending the night together before heading to the airport en masse .  the littlest kid  kevin  is the victim of the older kids cruelty .  kevins patience runs out when he learns that his plain-cheese pizza has already been eaten  and hes going to have to starve .  he attacks his big bully brother buzz  who had been teasing him .  the fight disrupts the already-chaotic dinner  spilling milk and soft drinks all over the table  a few cousins  and an uncle .  the knee-jerk reaction is for everyone to blame kevin .  nobody came to his rescue when he was being teased  but they all point their fingers when he fights back .  the ultimate punishment comes from mom ( catherine ohara ) who sends him up to the spare bedroom in the attic for the night .  on his way up the stairs  he tells her that  families suck  and that he hopes never to see any of his family again .  that night the power goes out  knocking out the alarm clocks  so the mcalisters wake up in a big hurry to get to the airport .  in a surprisingly plausible setup  kevin is mistakenly accounted for  and the family heads off without him .  its interesting that  in a subtle way  his parents never noticed him missing because of their deliberate desire to separate themselves from their children .  first they delegate the headcount to an older sibling  and second  they put all the kids in coach while they fly first class .  theyre two-thirds of the way across the atlantic before they realize they are missing a child .  meanwhile  kevin believes that somehow his wish has come true .  hes finally rid of his family !  life is a dream come true .  he can jump on the beds  watch r-rated movies  eat gobs of ice cream and potato chips  and dig through his big brothers secret box .  slowly  the novelty wears off and he settles into the mundane .  he grooms himself  he does the laundry  he goes shopping (  i bought some milk  eggs  and fabric softener  ) .  he also starts to miss his family  not just for their company  but for the security they bring .  the furnace in the basement is a scary monster  the old man next door is a snow-shovel murderer  and two crooks are trying to break into his house .  macaulay culkin is cute but he isnt much of an actor .  still  we can see that kevins character grows  thanks to some good direction and editing .  for example  acting has little to do with the emotional impact of the scene where kevin searches out a seasonal santa at night  just as  santa  is getting in his car .  kevin asks the man to pass on his request - he wants his family back - to the real santa .  he learned how to deal with the furnace .  you turn on the lights and its not so scary anymore .  he goes to a church one evening and there he sees the snow-shovel murderer  who actually turns out to be a nice man .  they talk about their fears and kevin learns that age alone does not make you less afraid .  finally  in the last 20 minutes  kevin confronts his last fear - the bandits  head on ( literally ) .  this last act is full of violent comedic slapstick  and after the movies genuine dramatic setup  it is dessert .  its a lot of fun  and it doesnt overwhelm the rest of the movie .  on the whole  home alone is a great holiday movie .  john williams original score has the sound and feel of holiday music without the disadvantage of being overplayed at the malls  and the christmas setting can put you in the mood for those family gatherings .  but it does have its flaws .  the smallest problem is that culkin doesnt act very well .  as i said before  he is cute  but repeated viewings reveal more about how columbus covered himself than about culkins insight into his character .  the biggest problem is that during the cartoony coda  the villains threaten kevins life about five times .  instead of  im gonna get that kid  they say  im gonna kill that kid .   some might argue that the tone is the same  but i strongly disagree .  mixing comedy with specific and viable threats of murder is a sociopathic faux-pas .  ill probably never see home alone 3  and i wish i had skipped home alone 2  but i do enjoy home alone almost every year .  dont let your impressions of the others detract from the original  which has much more to offer than cartoon slapstick .  , POS-- comedy  rated pg  runs about 1 : 40 -- starring : john goodman  kathy moriarty  and a bunch of teenagers -- directed by joe dante and written by charles hass --  summary : lawrence woolsley ( john goodman ) brings his new horror film mant !  to premiere in key west during the height of the cuban missile crisis .  he hopes to capitalize on the tense moment by providing an escape for the town .  we see most of the events through the stories of four teenagers and how life affects them .  quick and easy review : i really enjoyed matinee .  the mixture of comedy and tension blended nicely .  unlike many comedies this film tries  and succeeds  in getting past the stage of doing anything for a laugh .  the makers of the film also cared about telling an intelligent story .  the performances of all the principals are right on the mark  particularly john goodman as the schlock master .  so i would definitely recommend this film to anyone looking for a light hearted  yet interesting way to spend a couple of hours .  longer  more detailed review : [beware of spoilers]  the primary reason i enjoyed this film was  that while being a comedy  the film also had an intelligent story to tell .  too many comedies today subscribe to the the notion that a comedy need only make you laugh .  you watch the movie  laugh a lot  leave the theatre and take nothing with you .  matinee is not like that .  i left the picture thinking about what i would do faced with the cuban missile crisis .  i found myself wondering what would happen to the characters of the film .  but most importantly  i found myself caring about what would happen to the characters .  the comedy of the film centers around goodman  his character  and the film he brings to key west .  i believe that goodman is one of the finest comedic actors in the business today .  he is highly expressive both physically and vocally .  i felt he at least deserved an oscar nomination for his work in barton fink .  the other characters are often lost in a scene with him due to his commanding nature  however  while the star  goodman is actually not at the center of the film .  the movie is really the story of the four teenagers  discovering who they are and what they want  against a background where at any minute it could all end .  i thought the kids reaction were highly realistic .  they tried to block it out  they tried to escape from the concerns of their world .  unfortunately it kept creeping back in  particularly with the fear  and the chaos of the time .  while the comedy centered on goodman  and the drama on the teens  there was a great deal of overlap .  several aspects of the panic are shown in a humorous light .  one example is a scene where people are fighting each other for the the last cans and boxes of food in a grocery store .  if you think about it the threat of nuclear annihilation seems hardly to be the backdrop for a comedy  but it works here .  another reason i like this film is that i like b- science fiction movies .  one of my favorite films to go watch is plan 9 from outer space .   ( note i did not say it was one of my favorite movies  but one of my favorite to see . )  while mant !  never got made  many films like it were  and mant !  serves mostly as dantes homage to the b-films he loves .  so again i would like to recommend matinee to anybody looking for a good  humorous story .  this isnt a gag film like many other comedies but an intelligent  well-thought out  film about real people with real problems told in an often hilarious way .  enjoy !  , POSwhen _star wars_ came out some twenty years ago  the image of traveling throughout the stars has become a commonplace image .  when the millenium falcon moves throughout the stars  we see constellations  meteor showers  and cool space-ships .  when han solo goes light speed  the stars change to bright lines  going towards the viewer in lines that converge at an invisible point .  cool .  _october sky_ offers a much simpler image--that of a single white dot  traveling horizontally across the night sky .  was it really only forty years ago  when sputnik was launched  and that before then  no satellites ever existed ?  have we become so technologically advanced that we have forgotten that it was nearly two generations ago where people stood outside to breathlessly see a then-technological achievement  even though it was from the russians ?  it sounds hokey  but when that scene occurs near the beginning of _october sky_  i found myself caught up with the enthusiasm of homer hickam  played by jake gyllenhaal .  determined to make a dent in the space race  he becomes transfixed with his desire to make a rocket that could fly like the best of them .  it is films like this that we know the ending as we buy the ticket .  when lovely teacher miss riley ( played by laura dern )  suggests that he enters his findings into the national science fair  we know exactly who is going to win .  but the joy in a film like this is in the little details .  for example  homer is clearly not the strongest student in his class .  if he has any strengths whatsoever  it is an undeterring vision  and a good organizer .  it means that he may have to lose his reputation by associating with the nerdiest kid in school  who knows more about rocket science than he does .  it means that if his father forbids him to shoot rockets on company property ( that is  the entire coal-mining town )  he must walk eight miles one way  just to set up the rockets  which will fail  fail  fail  and fail again .  homer+s dad is played by chris cooper  a favorite actor of mine since _lone star_ .  here he plays the antithesis of the character he played in _matewan_ : instead of organizing union rallies  he is the head of the coal-miners  who is constantly wringing his hands against the unions .  this is will be one of the great unnoticed performances of the year : note how multi-dimensional his character is .  he is his son+s last nemesis  as one who most likely interferes with his son+s dreams .  but he truly loves his son  and wants to see him succeed the only way he knows how .  through coal-mining .  because of his character  we can see how far we+ve come .  the revolution of modern technology has allowed for us to see society advanced at a rate far faster than any generation before us .  we don+t understand that there were the generations from the industrial revolution who knew of no other way to raise a family .  the paradigm was shifting under the father+s feet  and he knew of no other life .  so _october sky_  far from being merely a feel-good inspirational film  offers much food for thought .  and this is the best type of inspirational film ; the one that you take something with you .  btw  the final image of the film is just as simple  is as strong a contrast as the aforementioned horizontal-moving white dot against the night-sky background .  another commonplace image  to be sure  but it must have been breathtaking forty years ago .  , POSwarning : contains what the matrix is .  rated r for sci-fi violence .  starring : keanu reeves  laurence fishburne  joe panteliano  some may be disappointed with the matrix .  ill tell you i was .  i sat there and sat there and sat there waiting for something to happen .  now wait wait  i know most of you loved it  and im not saying i didnt like it .  what im saying is the first half was extremely slow .  now seeing the trailer it makes you think the whole entire movie is one big special effects show .  dont be fooled  this movie has a big story .  and big chunks of talky moments .  but i will admit the special effects and the acting were above par  deserving the rating above .  ok now to the story .  well this may take a while .  ok first of all  our world we live in now  is not the real world  actually we live inside a computer generated world known as the matrix .  a man played by keanu reeves is about to find that out  when is kidnapped and almost coaxed to go into the real world .  he does so  and finds out that he can do anything  be anything he wants to be .  but he has to fight a matrix skipping bad guy  who wants to send him back to his own world or destroy him .  laurence fishburne  his guide of sorts plays his character well as does keanu reeves .  but i sat in the theatre for over and hour wondering where all the special effects were .  yeah there were some in the first half but not enough .  the trailer for this movie was really decieving making people think that this was a special effects laden movie .  now for the second half  it is explosive  and saves the movie .  some of the special effects and fighting were breathtaking .  the sound  the music  and all the effects were effective  and the last hour kept us entertained .  but with a running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes  this movie is at least 40 minutes too long .  one would have wished for a better matrix  but i do have to say  i did like it and i was entertained .  , POSnational lampoons animal house  made in 1978 and set in 1962  remains one of the -- no  fuck that noise -- * the * funniest movie ever made .  and this isnt just my opinion  either ; everybody knows this  and thats why about a gazillion inferior rip-offs have been made  trying to duplicate its success .   ( pcu anyone ?  and the first person to bring up glory daze gets decked . )  animal house takes place at the fictional faber college  circa 1962  where the omega frat calls the shots .  these guys are wholesome  clean-cut  model-citizens . . .  i . e .  a bunch of assholes .  greg  their leader  is going out with mandy pepperidge  but since the silly bastard doesnt believe in pre-marital sex  their relationship never goes further than a quick jack-off under the stars .  neidermeyer is the supreme-bozo of the bunch  walking around with his dick out kicking freshman ass and trying to impress the muff .  also hanging around these losers is babs  future universal studios employee and serious bitch .  now lets just take a peak next door  at the delta house .  over here  anything goes : you wanna throw shit out the window ?  okay .  you wanna crush a bunch of beer cans on your forehead and pour honey-mustard all over your chest ?  go right ahead .  the frats leaders are otter and boon ( tim matheson and peter riegert ) .  otter is the ladies man  going out with another girl every night  and boon is the comedian .  hes got a steady-date  katy ( karen allen )  but shes sick of playing second-fiddle to a bottle of j . d .  then there are the others : pinto  a wimp ; flounder  a blimp ; d . day  a biker ; stork  who may or may not have brain-damage ; and last but not least . . .  bluto !  bluto  played by the late  great john belushi  is the man .  hes the kind of guy who slugs back entire fifths of whiskey then proclaim   i needed that .   the kind of guy who puts a cream-filled snowball into his mouth  puffs up his cheeks and spits it out  and then says  im a zit -- get it ?   the story is as follows : the omegas are getting the deltas kicked off campus .  the deltas  knowing that fighting the omegas is stupid  decide to go out with style  throwing a wild toga party and ruining the homecoming parade .  this is the fucnniest movie int he history of the world .  do yourself a favor and go see it .  , POSevery year  hollywood crowns a new  it boy  --a young actor pegged for major movie stardom .  inheriting the mantle from last years  winner   matthew mcconaughey  is matt damon  and  like mcconaughey  he proves to be more than just a fresh young face  as evidenced in two radically different projects currently in release--john grishams the rainmaker and good will hunting .  damon has his first major starring role  a la mcconaughey  in a john grisham adaptation--in this case  francis ford coppolas take on the rainmaker .  damon plays wet-behind-the-ears attorney rudy baylor  who  immediately after passing the bar exam  finds himself representing the mother ( mary kay place ) of a terminally ill young man ( john whitworth ) in a big-league suit against a negligent insurance company .  while rudys ( and the films ) main concern is this case  he also finds time to protect a young wife ( claire danes ) from her abusive husband ( melrose placer andrew shue  in a mercifully brief role ) .  written for the screen and directed by coppola  the rainmaker is the best grisham film yet mostly because it does not take itself too seriously .  coppolas most notable--and effective--contribution to the tried-and-true grisham formula is a sense of humor about itself  which largely comes in the presence of danny devito ( as rudys unlicensed co-counsel ) and golden globe nominee jon voight ( as the insurance companys hotshot attorney ) .  the inclusion of the battered wife subplot feels rather superfluous  but danes is as superb as always .  then  of course  there is damon  who nicely juggles the weighty ( the insurance case  the spousal abuse ) and the humorous ( rudys often comical naivete ) requirements of his role without missing a beat .  as good as he is in the rainmaker  damon showcases the depth of his talent in good will hunting  directed by gus van sant and written by actor ben affleck and damon himself .  damon plays the title character  will hunting  a troubled young construction worker/janitor at mit who also happens to be a supergenius .  in an attempt to steer this brilliant young mind in the right direction  an mit math professor ( stellan skarsgard ) taps his old college friend  community college psychologist sean mcguire ( robin williams )  to counsel the abrasive  standoffish will and try to help him come to terms with his turbulent life .  good will hunting is the touchy-feely enterprise its plot synopsis suggests  but to simply dismiss it as that would be to discount the true emotional chords affleck and damons intelligent script touches .  even though no one ( and  if so  _very_ few people ) can directly relate to wills burden of superhuman intelligence  the insecurities he suffers are universal .  the material is brought to life by the terrific ensemble of actors .  williams delivers a nice dramatic turn ; affleck  a hot up-and-coming actor himself ( chasing amy )  turns up in a warm and charming performance as wills best friend ; and the ever-appealing minnie driver shines as wills harvard-schooled love interest .  the clear standout in the cast  though  is damon  who bravely does not soften wills prickly nature but has such a natural ease with the audience that it is hard _not_ to care for him .  so many names come and go with the fluctuations of the hollywood hype machine  but based on his impressive work in john grishams the rainmaker and especially good will hunting  it is a safe bet that matt damon is one name we will be hearing a lot more of in the years to come .  , POSsynopsis : leonard shelby ( pearce ) is a former insurance investigator on the trail of the man who killed his wife .  leonard has only a few clues to the murderers identity ; to make matters worse  he suffers from a condition which inhibits the creation of short-term memories  meaning that leonard is always forgetting what happened just minutes earlier .  because of this  leonard is forced to rely on notes he leaves for himself .    memento  traces the investigation back in time from its apparent culmination .  review :  memento  is the sort of movie i wish id written ; i can think of no higher praise than that .  i am envious that nolan has concocted such a brilliant  involved  original movie as this .  an instant film noir classic   memento  is virtually flawless .  the script is unlike any i have ever seen -- a notable achievement in these days of recycled hollywood homogeneity .  although the idea of starting at the  conclusion  of the plotline and then moving backward in time to the  start  is not entirely new  never before have i witnessed it executed with such flair and coherence .    memento  is endlessly exciting and inventive  a rare story which keeps the viewers guessing during the film itself  and mulling over its connotations long after leaving the theatre .  and it is not merely an exercise in cerebrality ; there is plenty of action and an unexpected dose of humour to keep the proceedings lively .  nolans direction is equally effective  never losing its crispness and clarity despite  memento  s challenging gimmick .  and to top everything off  all the performances rise to the occasion .  pierce is terrific as the troubled leonard ; moss shows great range as enigmatic natalie ; and pantolianos teddy achieves a splendidly affable yet sinister quality .    memento  may be the years best screenplay  and is certainly amongst the top theatrical attractions of 2001 .  , POSearth is a harsh  unconsoling drama about the time when india gained independence from britain and the ensuing turmoil that engulfed the subcontinent .  people who supposedly loved the same land and the same god found themselves in bitter conflict  as the country divided into factions fighting in the streets : indian and pakistani ; muslim  hindu  sikh  parsee .  the story takes place in lahore  which was indian before partition  and pakistani afterward  regardless of what its citizens might call themselves .  the action is seen through the eyes of lenny ( maaia sethna )  a young parsee girl  but it is really about her nanny  shanta .  shanta has a small circle of male admirers .  two of the men are suitors : hasan ( rahul khanna )  a hindu  and dil navaz ( aamir khan )  a muslim .  the others--sikh  hindu  muslim--are older ; some are married ; but all appreciate shanta  who is played by the stirringly beautiful nandita das .   ( she also starred in deepa mehtas previous film  fire  the first part of a thematic trilogy which will conclude with water . )  in an early scene  the men are sitting in a park talking with shanta and lenny ; political tension in the country is growing as the day of independence nears .  one of the men remarks  jokingly  that their little group is probably one of the last places in the city where the different religions can still get along .  he is wrong : the men make barbed little comments to each other  spoken like jokes  but with an undercurrent of fanaticism .  the tenor of these exchanges grows darker and more bitter as the movie progresses .  it is easy to perceive  in these squabbles  the trajectory which ends in mass violence and slaughter .  the group around shanta represents  in a sense  a united india  and shanta herself the ideal motherland--one which all love  which inspires hindu  muslim  and sikh to live peacably together .  but the circle around shanta is sundered  as is the state .  a sikh is persecuted  hides  then flees .  another man is murdered .  the group of friends will not meet again .  the movie is rife with images of breakage and destruction : a plate shattered on the floor  a stuffed toy torn apart by an upset child  and  most brutally  when the tension escalates into violence  a man is held down  tied between two cars  and ripped in half by the opposing movement of the vehicles .  it is a visceral and effective metaphor for a country which is being destroyed just as painfully .  the crux of earths plot is the transformation undergone by dil navaz .  his sisters are killed in brutal fashion  by hindus  because they are muslim .  dil navaz seeks solace from shanta  and asks in desperation that she marry him .  but she loves hasan  and tenderly refuses dil navazs offer .  the combination of familial anguish and romantic rejection twists inside him  and it is easy to see how he is seduced by the growing mob mentality : the muslim cause gives him a motive to vent his anger and hate .  despite the things he later does  it is to the credit of earth that it does not simply denounce dil navaz and those like him  but shows how circumstances can make decent enough men do monstrous things .  the conclusion--the consequence of dil navazs transformation--is rather abrupt .  the story earth tells does not end .  it just stops .  it is an appropriate finish : giving us closure would have imparted  at least on an aesthetic level  a sense of resolution  of satisfaction .  but there was no resolution for india and pakistan--they have been at war  on a small or large scale  for decades .  since the personal dramas in earth mirror the political struggles of a nation  it is only right that those dramas should have no terminus .  there is no healing to be had  no closure  on any level ( despite the needless  tacked-on ending  with voice-over narration from lenny as an adult  framing the story ) .  earth is  in some ways  an unexceptional movie .  it does not reinvent the wheel  following instead the standard pattern of historical dramas .  but deepa mehtas directon is assured  and the issues she addresses run deep .  earth does for india what movies like zhang yimous to live and tian zhuangzhuangs the blue kite did for china : they show us the agonies endured by unremarkable people who had the bad luck to be caught up and smashed in the crucible of history .  such films strike me as inherently valuable  even when flawed .  they may be biased or inaccurate  but they bear the weight of human hardship  and this confers on them a nobility and gravity which other  more inventive films  often lack .  it is notable that all three movies were banned in their native countries : the events shown may have happened decades ago  but they still touch a nerve .  the issues tackled in earth have a particular urgency in light of the nuclear test bombings that took place last year .  in the near future  india and pakistan may launch nuclear missiles at each other .  at the time of the tests i had some understanding of the reasons why this might happen ; after seeing earth  i have a much  much better understanding .  , POSup until about a year ago  john travoltas career consisted of those  look whos talking  movies ( notice how they never called them look whos talented ) and the 1991 bomb shout ( which was bad enough to make most people scream ) .  but somewhere along the line  travolta got the starring role in the tarantino masterpiece pulp fiction and his career soared once again .  weird how someone whose career was on par with the bee gees back in 1978 would experience fame and fortune once again  while barry  robin and maurice gibb could do no better than a 1993 straight-to-the-cutout-bin album aptly named  size isnt everything  ( and of course  they learned that sales are everything ) .  but now travoltas back on the hollywood scene once again  and i think we all know why .  four words : contract with the devil .  and this has nothing to do with newt gingrichs  contract with america .   no  satan is much more humane .  anyway  yes  travolta has sold his soul to the hairy host of the netherworld .  how do i know ?  i own the document in question .  amazing what you can buy at those collectors shops for a few hundred dollars  isnt it ?  get shorty continues in the vein of pulp fiction  with travolta as crime minion chili palmer .  he goes to collect some of the mafias money from a b-grade director ( gene hackman ) and suddenly finds out he wants out of the mob game and into the movie game .  sure  a ruthless criminal like him is far too honest to make it in hollywood  but i guess thats beside the point .  palmer is determined to get hackmans next project made  so he sets out to convince big star martin weir ( danny devito ) to star in the movie  bringing along down-and-out horror actress karen flores ( rene russo )  who has already had affairs with hackman and devito .  it doesnt take a las vegas odds-maker to predict that she and travolta will soon be hitting the sheets as well  after the customary sexual tension and denial  which has been used in every comedy from  whos the boss ?   to speechless .  it works in this case  unlike  whos the boss ?   although its interesting to note that tony danza has signed a contract with the devil also .  complicating matters somewhat are the mobsters who have backed hackmans other films and want in on this one too  along with travoltas mob boss trying to track him down for defecting .  get shorty is by no means on the same level as pulp fiction  despite the obvious similarities .  this movie doesnt have near the amount of originality or depth as pulp fiction but it is definitely one of the most entertaining movies ive seen this year ( yes  even better than halloween vi ) .  get shorty is my kind of movie  one that mixes intelligent humor with action and violence .  im definitely going to have to check out the novel it was based on .  are you getting this  shorty ?  , POSi was fortunate enough to attend an advance screening for the upcoming thriller conspiracy theory .  this was  of course  a big deal for me because reviewing movies is basically just a hobby for me and i never get a chance at something like this .  not only did i get to see an advance screening  i was able to see an advance screening of a * very good * movie .  the very fast-paced film stars mel gibson as jerry fletcher  a fast-talking  witty  comical taxi driver in new york city .  gibsons performance is terrific  and his character is similar to that of martin riggs in the lethal weapon films .  gibson again teams up with richard donner  as he did in the lethal weapon films and maverick  and this time around  the combination works even better .  the character of jerry fletcher is indeed unique .  try to imagine a toned-downed version of travis bickle who  this time around  is a jittery guy with knowledge of government conspiracy cover-ups .  if you can imagine that  then youve basically got jerry fletcher .  in many ways  i was surprised by this movie .  to begin with  i was surprised at how good it was .  dont get me wrong  its not going to be accepting any gold trophies next spring  but it was a very enjoyable movie .  secondly  i was surprised at mel gibsons performance .  he provided a fantastic performance .  the previews of this film led me to believe it was an all-out action flick  which after viewing  it was almost the opposite in a certain sense .  gibsons character has an almost uncountable number of one-liners  hilarious situations  and his character is one that the audience tends to side with throughout the film .  for instance  jerrys apartment ( and especially his security ) is memorable .  and last  i was surprised at how good the plot is .  writer brian helgeland has created a terrific story  and when watching this film  you are left to wonder if all of jerry fletchers far-fetched ( or so they seem at first ) conspiracy theories are helgelands own opinions .  mel gibson isnt the only stand-out in the film .  julia roberts is very good in her performance as alice sutton  the department of justice employee who cant seem to stay away from jerry fletcher  who continually visits alice in hopes that she will do something about his theories .  he also seems obsessed and in love with her .  but whenever he approaches her with another one of his theories  she shrugs him and his beliefs off  continually noting that one day she is going to slap a restraining order on him .  jerry  obviously determined to continually seek out the truth  continues to research information for his next conspiracy theory  which will be printed in his newsletter ( same title as the movie ) .  although he only has five subscribers  he puts a large amount of time and effort into his work  and publishes his next edition .  very soon after he does so  he is abducted and tortured by a sinister man who refers to himself as dr . jonas ( patrick stewart ) .  after barely escaping alive  jerry is forced to turn to the only person he can trust : alice sutton .  the remainder of the film is almost always fast-paced and full of action and suspense  with jerrys life being constantly put into jeopardy .  and more along the way  the audience ( and alice ) learn more and more about jerrys life .  many things are explained throughout this film  both to the characters and to the audience .  for instance  the meaning of the book  the catcher in the rye  and its ties to assassins  the reason lone gunmen have three names ( e . g .  lee harvey oswald and james earl ray )  and the real truth behind the grateful dead .  make sure listen closely throughout the film  as jerry is constantly throwing out interesting tidbits such as the above .  definitely  when conspiracy theory hits theaters august 8th  make sure you are standing in line to see it .  i am nearly positive everyone should enjoy this film  especially if you are into an action-thriller with witty dialogue and numerous suspenseful situations .  and even if you arent  you should still like this film .  , POSthe disney studios has its formula for annual  full-length animated features down so pat that its hard to remember which one youre watching at any given moment .    mulan   their 36th animated adventure  is the latest case in point .  once again we have a tale focused around a strong central character ( female as usual ; disney is one of the few studios whose heroines--ariel  belle  pocahontas  and now mulan--get equal screen time with their heroes in recent years ) .  add the requisite love interest and a wise-cracking sidekick or two  pep up the soundtrack with a handful of strategically placed show tunes ( an introspective number by a pool or looking in a mirror  a rousing anthem  a cutesy  montage-backed crowd pleaser )  pose a few threats to our engaging lead  and tie things all up neatly by the closing credits .  bobs your uncle !  better make that walts your uncle . . .  kids will no doubt go ga-ga over  mulan  ( or at least the fast food tie-ins )  but familiarity can  after a while  leave grown-ups--this reviewer included--wishing for a little more .  maybe an animated feature without--shock !  horror ! --the  songs  for example ?  or maybe a film in which a cheeky chihuahua called pepe longs to become a matador from trinidad ? ?  how about simply ditching the sidekicks altogether ?  it isnt gonna happen .  like disneys previous entries   mulan  is slow to make its mark .  the animation tends to suffer from some slackness in the early going and the humorous element  a madcap dragon wannabe ( in the guise of a loquacious lizard with a case of dry mouth  courtesy eddie murphys animated vocal talents )  plays like an inappropriate if necessary ( formula-wise ) afterthought .  however  after about an hour everything comes together and the formula  like it or not  clicks .  highlights include a spectacular cavalry charge on a snow-covered pass ( which  due to the sophistication of todays computer-generated imagery  is hard to tell from the real thing )  a memorable  show-stopping musical interlude (  ill make a man out of you   penned by matthew wilder and david zippel )  and last but not least  mulan herself .  voiced by ming-na wen  mulan is disneys strongest female character to date .  when hordes of huns pour over chinas great wall and threaten to overthrow the imperial palace  the emperor decrees that every family in the land dispatch one man to serve in the imperial army .  since mulans father is infirm  but proud  the high-spirited mulan steals her fathers armor and  incognito  signs up to face the mongolian menace .  attracted to  but not distracted by  her commanding officer shang ( b . d .  wong )  mulan outmatches her fellow combatants in smarts  wit  and physical ability .  shes a woman of the 90s a couple of millennia ahead of her time .  , POSi had been expecting more of this movie than the less than thrilling twister .  twister was good but had no real plot and no one to simpithize with .  but twister had amazing effects and i was hoping so would volcano  volcano starts with tommy lee jones at emo .  he worrys about a small earthquake enough to leave his daughter at home with a baby sitter .  there is one small quake then another quake .  then a geologist points out to tommy that its takes a geologic event to heat millions of gallons of water in 12 hours .  a few hours later large amount of ash start to fall .  then . . . . it  starts .  the volcanic eruption . . . .  i liked this movie . . . but  it was not as great as i hoped .  i was still good none the less .  it had excellent special effects .  the best view . . . the  helecopters flying over the streets of volcanos .  also . . . there were interesting side stories that made the plot more interesting .  so . . . it was good ! !  , POSdisneys 35th animated feature-- a retooling of the olympian legend crossed with  well  the superman story-- is surprisingly soft at the center .  great wit  great art  and a great villain ( james woods as hades  lord of the underworld and local lounge act ) cant quite stifle the yawns induced by a bland hero  his colorfully monotonous sidekick ( danny devito as the satyrical trainer phil )  and a largely unremarkable soundtrack .   ( none of the alan menken/david zippel tunes are particular- ly noteworthy .  some lack lyrical snap .  others need more memorable melodies .  boring ballads we expect  but boring production numbers  too ? )  so  hercules is a bit of a long sit  but you wont stay bored .  the highlights include a nifty round of animated action ( herc battling a cgi hydra )  a steady stream of anachronisms (  somebody call ix-i-i  ) and pop references (  lets get ready to rumble !  ) a la aladdin  and several long-overdue jabs at the mouses marketing and merchandising depart- ments .  while not as rock-solid as hunchback  its a still a new world of improvement over pocohontas .  directed by ron clements and john musker  with voice credits including tate donovan  susan egan  bob goldthwait  matt frewer  samantha eggar  paul shaffer  and  as lighting bolt zeus  rip torn  whos having a very good summer  also appearing in trial and error and men in black .  , POSthe computer-animated comedy  shrek  is designed to be enjoyed on different levels by different groups .  for children  it offers imaginative visuals  appealing new characters mixed with a host of familiar faces  loads of action and a barrage of big laughs ( including numerous gags related to body functions and yucky substances  apparently a requisite in contemporary family films ) .  for adults  its a fractured fairy tale packed with rude jokes that will sail over the heads of the kids .  all in all   shrek  is a snappy ride  although there are a couple of points i found disturbing .  but first the basics .  based very loosely on a 1990 childrens story   shrek  follows several momentous days in the life of the title character  a rotund green ogre voiced by mike myers in that pleasant scottish accent he is so fond of using .  shrek is a grumpy fellow living a solitary life deep in the swamp  until a local nobleman disturbs his peace .  petty tyrant lord farquaad ( take away the  awk  in the middle and you have the basis of a string of impolite one-liners ) owns the land on which shrek resides .  he proceeds to turn the ogres yard into an ellis island for storybook characters when he banishes the fanciful beings from his castle .  as a result  shrek finds himself surrounded by legends like the three blind mice  pinocchio  the big bad wolf  the seven dwarfs  and the three bears  to name but a few .  an enraged shrek storms to the castle  only to find farquaad ( john lithgow ) ready to bargain .  lord obnoxious wants to become king and the magic mirror from  snow white  has shown him the way .  all he has to do is rescue a damsel in distress and make her his wife .  the mirror unveils three choices in a presentation straight out of  the dating game  ( when snow white is shown  the cheeky announcer purrs   even though she lives with seven men  shes not easy !  )  farquaad selects the lovely princess fiona ( cameron diaz ) and offers shrek a deal : if the ogre snatches fiona from the dragon-protected  lava moat-filled castle in which she is held captive and brings her to the throne  the lord will allow the fairy tale pests to move back on his grounds .  shrek reluctantly agrees and sets off on his quest  accompanied by a motor-mouthed donkey ( eddie murphy ) determined to make the green grump his best friend .  they finally hook up with the princess  only to learn she is not the helpless maiden they expected to meet .  for the matter  the dragon offers a few surprises as well .  the movie references a great many other flicks  from  babe  (  thatll do  donkey .  thatll do  ) to  the graduate .   but the lions share of the jokes come at the expense of the wonderful world of disney .  the public-domain characters made into icons in various disney films take their hits ? pinocchio is referred to as a  possessed toy  and when shrek spies a sleeping snow white in his cabin  he bellows   get that dead broad off the table !    ? but the biggest slams come when shrek visits farquaads royal domicile  which closely resembles a certain magic kingdom  from its souvenir stands and queue lines to a display of animatronic figures that sing the palace rules in a relentlessly peppy tune that sounds a lot like  its a small world .   which brings me to disturbing point number one .  i laughed at all the disney swipes  but found the mentality behind them a bit sad .  the acrimony between dreamworks honcho jeff katzenberg and disney big wheel michael eisner is well known .  for years the two companies have tried to sabotage each others film and video releases by issuing similar competing productions on the same day .  and now we have katzenberg using an entire movie to attack his former employer .  heres a suggestion for the two boys : grow up !  put the past behind you !  theres room in the sandbox for both of you and if you farquaads cant play nice  then go to your rooms !  the other area i found troubling came in the portrayal of lord farquaad .  beyond all the irreverence   shrek  actually has a message : people should learn to look beyond physical appearances  because true beauty lies within .  its a lovely notion  but the film betrays its own moral by incessantly taking cheap shots at farquaads diminutive stature .  do we really need a family film reinforcing the idea that mocking short people is acceptable ?  the pompous  selfish behavior of farquaad is enough to make him a target for zingers .  adding short jokes is simply mean .  still   shrek  is a rollicking good time .  the computer animation is mostly impressive ( although several key characters look like animated rubber squeeze toys and the human movements are often jerky )  the voice work is strong ( particularly from eddie murphy )  the laughs come fast and furious  and the moral  tainted though it may be  is a good one .  to trot out a clich ?   shrek  is fun for all ages .  parents  though  should remind their young ones during the ride home that taunting others because they are short  tall  skinny  fat  etc . is a bad thing .  , POSafter watching the first ten minutes of this japanese film  you will never eat a bowl of ramen the same way again .  there is a scene where an old man is teaching a young one how to eat the soupy bowl of noodles  as a master would teach an eager apprentice .    you caress the noodles with the chopsticks   he says   then put the roast pork on the side of the bowl and apologize to it by saying  see you soon .    of course  its meant to be a parody  but there is an earnestness underneath the silliness that makes you take it with a certain degree of sobriety .  you begin to appreciate the food as not merely something you eat  not something you like  not something you enjoy  but rather something you experience .  experiencing it is a process which engages all of the senses  fulfilling each one on its own terms and weaving them so that the total is a pleasure that is more than the sum of its parts .  trust me  you really want to go find a noodle shop at this point .  juzo itamis tampopo brings the same sense of the serious parody of food to the forefront by making the story follow the pattern of an american western  set in modern day japan .  a stranger  goro ( tsutomu yamazaki )  comes into town and finds tampopo ( nobuko miyamoto )  the proprietor of a small  hole-in-the-wall noodle shop  trying to fend off the insults of the local strongman  pisken ( rikiya yasuoka ) .  goro  to defend the honor of this woman and her noodles  gets into a fight with the ringleader and his henchmen  emerging bloodied  but victorious .  goro finds that tampopos ambition is to have a shop that people would flock to from far away  just to eat a bowl of her ramen .  the problem is  her fare is something less than popular  and less than appetizing .  however  goro agrees to help tampopo in her quest  and in the process they seek the wisdom of an elderly noodle expert  enlist the aid of a wealthy patron  and make friends with the former enemy .  this film is filled with many little scenes which are absolute gems .  take  for example  when tampopo tries to buy the recipe for a delicious soup from another shop owner .  the price is too high  but the owner of the store next door will secretly sell it to her for a more affordable sum .  tampopo meets him at his store late at night  and he leads her to a back room .  she protests  thinking that perhaps this man has ulterior motives  but he insists .  just when she is about to bolt for the exit  he shows her a small gap in the wall adjoining his store with the noodle shop next door .  she peers through and takes notes as she watches the cook make the soup for the next day  her face filled with a joy that can be felt by the audience .  this scene  while comical  is very effective at filling the viewer with a sense of trepidation  then of relief and discovery .  theres also an interesting scene where goro introduces tampopo and her son to a bunch of street people who  despite their economic trappings  are all gourmets and master sommeliers .  we even watch as one of them sneaks into the kitchen of a restaurant and expertly prepares a french omelet .  the scene is meant to bring a laugh  but it also says that no matter whether people are rich or poor  food is something which everyone has in common  and the enjoyment of food is an experience shared by all .  there are also a number of unrelated vignettes appearing throughout the film  which help to illustrate and accentuate the role of food in peoples lives .  a particularly effective one involves a wife and mother being tended to in her home by a doctor .  surrounded by her children  she is obviously in her last hours of life .  her husband comes home  and seeing her worsened condition  demands that she get up and make dinner .  the viewer knows the husbands intention is not to be mean ; he is desperate for the normalcy of which he and his family has obviously been deprived  and the wife making dinner is an essential part of this .  in a near miracle  the wife drags herself to the kitchen and prepares a quick meal  then brings it to her awaiting family .  as the family eats  she looks on them and smiles .  preparing food for her family is a joy and a comfort to her  and for a brief moment  she too enjoys the normalcy .  then she falls over  dead .  for a moment  the family is stunned  but then the father yells at the children   keep eating !  this is the last meal your mother ever made !   crying as they do so  the family finishes the meal .  the scene is comical  awkward  moving  and beautiful .  by including the vignettes  itami ran the risk of creating a disjointed film  but surprisingly  they do not interrupt the pacing of the main storyline .  instead  they even help contribute to the idea that tampopos goal of being able to serve exceptional food is worthy and even noble .  because the film parodies a western  the construction of the plot is fairly predictable  but is still enjoyable as we watch the familiar way in which the  good guys  come together for the final showdown .  in this case  the showdown is against the ramen .  if they eat tampopos ramen  soup and all  tampopo knows she has succeeded .  its pretty obvious what the outcome will be  but when a film changes your whole perspective on something you consume every day of your life  you can afford to cut it a little slack .  , POStheres an old saying that states something about leaving the best for last .  george lucas certainly followed that adage when crafting the original star wars trilogy .  return of the jedi  the final installment of the series  is easily the most innovative  action-packed  and entertaining of the three films .  the dark  eerie atmosphere that oozed from every frame of the empire strikes back is gone .  instead  for return of the jedi  we have good triumphing decisively over evil  a resolution to a love triangle  and walking teddy bears .  even darth vader doesnt seem very intimidating this time around .  with the arrival of the emperor ( an apparition-like creature played by ian mcdiarmid )  vader has turned into somewhat of a henchman .  return of the jedi picks up at an unspecified time after the conclusion of the empire strikes back .  luke skywalker ( mark hamill )  princess leia ( carrie fisher )  lando calrissian  ( billy dee williams )  chewbacca ( peter mayhew )  c3p0 ( anthony daniels ) and r2-d2 ( kenny baker ) are on a rescue mission to lukes home planet of tatooine .  their goal : to save han solo ( harrison ford ) from the clutches of the intergalactic gangster jabba the hutt .  it is at jabbas home  a creepy-looking stone fortress guarded by hog-nosed beasts  that most of the added special effects come into play .  from a hysterical scene involving a music group to the dreaded beast outside jabbas sand barge  the effects are top notch .  as soon as han is freed from his cryo-freeze and rescued from the clutches of the evil jabba the hutt  its back to outer space  where the rebel alliance is about to face the empires newest threat : a second  more powerful death star  that  if activated  could spell doom for anyone who stands against the emperor .  so  while the fleet prepares for the final battle  luke and company travel to the forest moon of endor to knock out the shield that defends the death star against all attacks .  there  they are befriended by the ewoks  the teddy bear-like native race  and luke  fearing that his presence is endangering the group  turns himself over to vader .  return of the jedi has some interesting elements .  the scenes which pitted luke against the emperor and vader are suitably tense and well-acted .  from a technical point-of-view  the space battles are amazing  easily hindering anything depicted in the previous films .  not only are there many  many more ships  but their speed and range of movement have been dramatically improved .  on one level  return of the jedi is almost worth watching for the special effects .  in the special edition  even more ships are added  making the final space battle incredibly fun to watch .  the acting in return of the jedi is stronger than in the previous films .  by now ( or then - 1983 )  mark hamill  harrison ford  and carrie fisher have all matured in their on-screen personas .  the chemistry amongst the trio is terrific .  as in empire  billy dee williams gives us another human hero to root for .  newcomer ian mcdiarmid plays the emperor as a suitably creepy  cunning  and evil creature  although hes not as imposing as vader was in star wars .  although it was great fun watching star wars and the empire strikes back on the big screen  return of the jedi generates a greater sense of enjoyment .  with the spectacular  new special effects  the adorable ewoks  the sinister jabba the hutt  the evil emperor  the same old millenium falcon  darth vaders incredible betrayal  the destruction of the new death star  and the always lovable yoda  return of the jedi concludes one of the greatest trilogies ever made with a huge bang .  congratulations to george lucas  whose innovative mind entertains us now and will continue to entertain generations to come .     , POSwhy do so many childrens films treat their target audience with utter contempt ?  too many of those who write or direct for childrens movies assume that the kids just cant handle serious  thoughtful discussions on meaningful issues .    the iron giant   which was directed and co-written by brad bird  late of such animated series as  the simpsons  and  king of the hill   assumes that not only can children handle such discussions  but that they can do so while being entertained at the same time .    the iron giant  holds absolutely no contempt for the young people in the audience  making it a film thats enjoyable for both children and adults alike .  hogarth hughes ( voice of eli marienthal ) is a spirited young lad who lives with his hard-working single mother  annie ( jennifer aniston )  in a small town in maine .  after staying up late and watching scary movies on a night his mother is away  hogarth treks out into the forest to investigate what has stolen his antenna and ruined his tv reception .  he comes across a giant robot ( vin diesel ) from space that eats metal for food .  after saving the robot  nicknamed the iron giant  from electric shock  hogarth befriends the creature and takes him in as a pet of sorts .  because of damage he suffered upon landing  the giant has forgotten what his original mission was  so he just follows hogarth around like a lost puppy .  realizing he cant just keep the giant in a barn all the time  and that the giant needs food  he takes him to a junkyard owned by dean ( harry connick jr . )  an eccentric artist who assembles sculptures out of scrap iron in his spare time .  it soon becomes apparent that dean and hogarth cant keep the giant a secret forever  because a government spook named kent mansley ( christopher mcdonald ) has been brought in to investigate mysterious sightings in the surrounding forest area and considers the giant a threat to national security .  he suspects hogarth knows something about the giant  and takes up residence in hogarths house as a lodger .  meanwhile  the giant begins to exhibit ominous behavior that suggests he was built to be a weapon of some kind .    the iron giant  is exactly what family films ought to be  because it doesn t talk down to its audience .  the story is simple  very simple  about an alien being that drops out of the sky and befriends a young boy .  its very similar to the spielberg classic  e . t .   and such comparisons are actually deserved in the case of  the iron giant .   the film holds many of the better elements of spielbergs film  such as the ability to be sentimental without turning sappy .  the film delivers several serious messages  the most important of which is ones ability to choose ones own fate .  hogarth teaches the giant to go against his programming and become what he wants to be : a hero .  the final sequence is touching and appropriate  though i wont give it away  i will say that very few will be disappointed .  the animation  while not up to disney standards ( what could be  after  tarzan  ? )  is good enough to make you forget youre watching a cartoon .  the giant is computer-animated  while the human characters are all hand-drawn the old-fashioned way .  the characters faces are done quite well  drawn realistically enough to make the personalities credible  but the features are exaggerated so as to allow for the cartoonish expressions that provide for comic relief .  fine voice work is turned in by young eli marienthal as hogarth  and jennifer aniston is surprisingly convincing as his waitress mother .  harry connick jr . does a nice characterization as dean  and i really enjoyed the voice work of john mahoney ( of tvs  frasier  ) as an army general called in by agent mansley .  unlike several cartoon features  each character is actually a developed personality  rather than a stereotype  and is actually integral to the plot  rather than being a superfluous comic-relief sidekick ( a clich ? disney still hasnt ditched ) .  dean  for example  could have been a stereotypical beatnik ( his character profile seems to suggest that )  but he is presented as a character with real emotions  thoughts  and motivations .  even the heavy  agent mansley  is not a villain who does bad things simply because he wants to  but out of his own fear and paranoia .  a lesser animated feature would have drawn up paper-thin stereotypes and figure the kids wont mind  but  the iron giant  has clearly put a little work into making the characters real  and it pays off .  the film isnt only around to deliver heavy-handed messages  though .  its also very funny  and the humor is of the kind that both children and adults will enjoy .  the scenes in which hogarth teaches the giant to do certain things  such as dive into a pool  are handled well  and director brad bird clearly has a sense of comic timing  having worked on  the simpsons  for many years .  a sequence where hogarth and mansley attempt to  outlast  one another by trying to stay awake is very nicely timed  and also extremely clever .  the film even takes some jabs at americas nuclear paranoia during the early stages of the cold war  satirizing the lame safety films shown to grade school students that tell them to  duck and cover  in the event of a nuclear attack .    the iron giant  has much more of a satirical edge to it than most family films  and the edgy humor is actually quite refreshing .  instead of seeing people get bonked on the head  we get well-timed  clever gags that seem to have required some imagination to come up with .  when you get right down to it   the iron giant  is no more than the story of a boy and his robot .  the story is so straightforward  so quaint  that it ultimately becomes charming .  though i enjoy the complex plotting of film noir as much as the next person  when it comes to family entertainment  simple is the way to go .  its akin to one of those bedtime stories your father told that had you hanging on his every word  but its not the story that sets the film above others of its kind  but rather the elements that go into the story  namely real characters and thoughtful dialogue  which  the iron giant  has in spades .  , POSsusan grangers review of  the closet  ( miramax films )  in this hilarious french farce  a shy  boring accountant ( daniel auteil ) named francois pignon discovers hes going to be fired from his job at a condom factory .  lonely and distraught  he contemplates suicide .  but then he runs into belone ( michel aumont )  an elderly homosexual neighbor  who suggests a  sex discrimination  lawsuit to intimidate management .  as evidence  belone concocts provocative photographs of pignon locked in a leather-clad embrace with another man and mails them anonymously to pignons boss .  when the racy snapshots start circulating around the factory  not only does pignon get his job back but he suddenly finds himself the focus of attention as an openly gay man .  his lusty supervisor ( michele laroque ) is so intrigued that she wonders if  perhaps  she could change his sexual preferences .  even his ex-wife ( alexandra vandernoot ) and indifferent teenage son ( stanislas crevillen ) drop their disdain .  but not everyone is enchanted .  a mucho macho co-worker felix ( gerard depardieu )  a self-righteous homophobe  is stunned and repulsed when hes forced by the pr director ( thierry lhermite ) to grovel and court pignons friendship or risk losing his own job .  writer/director francis verber artfully milks the farcical comedy as he dissects the hypocrisy of political correctness  veering off-track only occasionally into pedophilia .  daniel auteuil (  the widow of saint-pierre  ) is delightful - particularly with a blown-up condom perched on his head  riding on a float in a gay pride parade - and gerard depardieu delivers one of his most restrained  and effective  performances .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10   the closet  is a frankly sexual  adult 8 .  its so clever  in fact  that hollywood is already planning to re-make it in english  like  la cage aux folles .   , POSroman emperor marcus aurelius ( richard harris ) chooses his trusted general maximus ( russell crowe ) as his successor .  however the emperors evil son commodus ( joaquin phoenix ) murders his father before the announcement can be made  and maximus ( as well as his family ) is sentenced to be executed .  maximus is able to escape his executioners  but is later captured and sold as a slave to proximo ( oliver reed ) .  proximo is looking for gladiators to earn himself money ( he being a former gladiator himself )  and maximus reluctantly uses his skills to prove himself a powerful gladiator .  when emperor commodus announces that new games will be held in the colisseum  proximo takes his gladiators there to do battle .  maximus sees this as his chance to exact revenge on commodus .  gladiator begins with a great battle sequence between the roman army and germania  and actually is able to maintain interest during the now required  40 minutes of exposition after a kick ass opening sequence  style of moviemaking .  the only downfall of the opening sequence is the editing style used . . .  its choppy slow-motion which is unsettling and distracting .  its similar to the opening sequence in saving private ryan  but nowhere near as effective .  the actual gladiator battles are thrilling  but also a bit disjointed .  many times its unclear as to exactly whats going on . . .  all the audience can tell is that blood is being spilled .  were not sure whos blood or by whos hand though .  theres an instance of this earlier in the film too thats disappointing .  its comes when maximus escapes his executioners .  some flashes and a few quick cuts later and maximus is free . . .  but i still dont know exactly how he did it .  russell crowe should have become a major star after his gleefully over the top role as a computer generated serial killer in 1995s virtuosity .  for whatever reason his stardom never arrived . . .  but he should have it now .  from here on moviegoers should now be able to say   lets go see the new russell crowe movie  .  he gets the best scene in the film ( and one of the best moments of all recent movies ) when he reveals his identity to commodus in the colisseum .  its both rousing and chilling .  joaquin phoenix does a very effective job of making commodus a person and not just a cartoon character ( which could have easily happened ) .  commodus is conniving  sneaky and whiny  but phoenix never lets the character get silly .  its a very good ( and very creepy ) performance .  oliver reed died during the filming of gladiator  and its a huge loss to the acting world .  ive always been fascinated with reed . . .  hes one of those very talented performers who once had a fine career but ended up in direct to video junk during his twilight years .  its ironic that this film probably would have gotten him back into real movies again  as he gives a fun and sincere performance .  the film is dedicated to him  and he will surely be missed .  reeds death presented the filmmakers with an obvious problem  as he still had scenes to be completed .  rather than recast the role ( and end up reshooting a great deal of footage )  a digital version of oliver reed was created at a reported cost of 2 million dollars .  ironically  that was probably more money than reed ever earned for a single film .  anyway  this digital effect is only used in one scene that i am aware of ( for about twenty seconds ) and if you arent looking for it you wont even be able to tell .  some of the other digital effects are less convincing however . . .  and like i always say  noticable digital effects take me out of a movie immediately .  its sad that such a good film has these distractions .  movies like the fall of the roman empire and spartacus seemed to do okay without the use of computer effects .  keep in mind that gladiator is based on real people and real events  but is entirely a work of fiction .  however its a work of fiction thats great entertainment  and another film to add to the list of damn fine flicks released in 2000 a . d .  , POSwhat a great film .  what a stunning  touching  heart-wrenching  heart-warming  life-affirming  miraculous film .  >from its opening moments  _life is beautiful_ walks that fine line between serious tragedy and uplifting comedy .  a car with no brakes speeds through the town  and guido ( roberto benigni ) motions people to move out of the way .  they mistake him to be the fascist president  traveling to their town that day .  heil !  heil !  huh ?  shortly thereafter  the president drives through  and people stare  with blank faces .  this is standard  but somehow fresh and postmodern stuff : the clown who is also a jew  triumphs over the anti-semitic society in which he = lives .  granted  _the great dictator_ comes to mind--charlie chaplin+s almost masterpiece .  i think lib ( which benigni wrote and directed ) trumps gd in one essential point : chaplin+s jewish barber gives a great speech at the climax  but to do so  he had to break completely from character .  benigni is given a similar situation : he is mistaken as a fascist dignitary  and must explain to a classroom filled with schoolchildren = on how scientists have concluded that aryans are the superior race .  benigni+s guido stays in character  and delivers the speech  keeping = the subject matter intact while showing the absurdity of its concept .  it = is one of the great satirical scenes in modern cinema .  there are many other scenes  especially in the first half  which are bright and loopy and funny and silly .  slapstick reigns  and although the film is subtitled  there was no doubt that a universal language was being conveyed .  and although it+s focus is on the courtship of guido = to dora ( played by nicoletta braschi  benigni+s real life wife )  a silent undercurrent creeps in .  this is clearly a racist society  evidenced by the aforementioned scene and others  and it will soon affect him and = his family .  the second half of the film takes place five years later  in an unnamed concentration camp  where guido  dora ( by her insistence )  and their five-year old son  giosu=e9 ( giorgio cantarini )  are deported .  guido  seeing the horrors  is desperate to protect his wife and child .  for = his wife  who is separated from him  he must find ways to communicate to = her that he is all right .  for his son  ( and this is the most controversial part of the film ) he convinces the youngster that this is all one big elaborate game : it+s rules include hiding  being very quiet  and learning to not ask for seconds .  which raises the big questions : how do we deal with pain ?  with persecution ?  with injustice on the worst level ?  it+s said that tragedies bring out the best in people  finding strengths they did not realize they had .  other times they deteriorate  become overwhelmed = with little strength or incentive to swim .  sometimes even  people giggle in these moments  as if there were a vacant emotion behind them  yearning for some brightness to soothe their wounds .  benigni+s guido realizes this .  he is the clown  but he is not a fool .  he sees the slurs and the vandalism  and while feeling the weight of = the verbal attacks  he still has the audacity to see if everyone around = him  perhaps even the antagonists  laugh .  his liberty is stripped  but not his dignity  and certainly not the dignities of those around him .  it+s obvious from the onset that here is someone who is very much against fascism and the preposterousness of an aryan nation  but does so with a grinning  joyful demeanor .  perhaps that is a form of denial .  perhaps his alternate reality is all that he could muster ( not unlike the very different _brazil_ ) .  or . . .  perhaps this is an example of great fortitude  with no weapons but = wit .  whatever his purposes is subject to debate  but also a sure sign that this is one of the great three-dimensional characters  stranded amidst = a terrifyingly risky concept .  surprisingly  it works .  it is an important footnote that this film was not intended to be an accurate reflection of the holocaust .  it+s not that the atrocities are trivialized  far from it .  they don+t have to be broadcast and explicitly shown to muster the same horror--less is more .  i believe = that benigni was cautious to preserve the tone  and i like the theory that = it is guido+s alternate reality that we+re seeing .  however  any criticism that this is rewriting history  that the holocaust wasn+t as bad as it seems  is simply off-target .  benigni+s film has won audience awards at cannes  at toronto  and is a definite shoo-in for best foreign language film ( hopefully for best picture as well ) .  he has been made an honorary jew by a jerusalem film society .  it swept the italian academy awards .  controversy notwithstanding  it is one of the great films this year  and as of this writing  the one to beat for best film .  masterful .  miraculous .  a must-see .  , POSingredients : starving artist lusting after a beautiful woman from his childhood  synopsis : great expectations ( 1998 ) is a modernized version of a charles dickens novel .  in the original charles dickens classic an orphan boy named pip learns about life through his friendship with an escaped convict  his relationship with a bitter old lady named miss havisham  and his hopeless lifetime infatuation with havishams snobbish adopted daughter  estella .  the gist of the story is that an anonymous benefactor sends pip to london for pip to become an upper class  gentleman .   pip leaves for london with  great expectations  to be groomed into a gentleman so that he can one day be classy enough to marry estella .  but life has a way of complicating things .  pip becomes an arrogant s . o . b .  until he learns just who his secret benefactor is .  in this new 1998 version of great expectations a poor florida lad named finn ( ethan hawke ) with a talent for drawing has an early memory of helping an escaped convict ( robert de niro ) .  but soon the focus of finns life becomes romance  as he develops a lifelong infatuation with estella ( gwyneth paltrow )  an upper crust girl with some psychological and emotional issues due to being raised in a dysfunctional environment .  estella was raised in wealth by ms . dinsmoor ( anne bancroft )  an eccentric  aged and embittered  man-hating single aunt whose groom left her abandoned at the altar on the day of her marriage .  this causes estella to fear the daylight of relationships  but finn thinks its just a case of snobbery .  when finn becomes a young man  an anonymous benefactor sets finn up in new york with the connections and publicity to be groomed into a famous artist .  finn leaves florida with  great expectations  to be a successful artist so that some day he might become classy enough to marry the snobbish estella .  what will happen to all of finns  great expectations ?   opinion : if youre looking for a romance with a happy ending  look no further ; youve found one here .  ethan hawke is romantic lead .   ( he romanced winona ryder in reality bites .  he romanced julie delpy in before sunrise .  he romanced uma thurman in gattaca .  now in great expectations he gets to chase gwyneth paltrow  a rail-thin blonde . )  hawke plays a lovestruck  earnest and unchanged finn throughout the film .  meanwhile paltrow portrays estella as alternating between infuriating tease and ice princess ; estellas whole purpose is to get men to fall in love and then hurt them rather than become intimate .  anne bancroft goes a little overboard as the deranged and pessimistic ms . dinsmoor  while robert de niro carries off the convict part suitably .  the difference between the classic dickens novel and this 1998 adaptation is that the dickens novel is ripe with deep and timeless themes about class struggle and love  whereas great expectations ( 1998 ) is more artsy  less complicated story about a 1990s artist dealing with a lifetime tease .  , POSyouve seen this moment before  recently : a particularly troubled character senses danger of the paranormal kind when the room temperature inexplicably plummets to below freezing .  the difference is that when it happens to lili taylors nell in the haunting  we dont care .  the hero of the sixth sense  a young boy named cole  is a rich creation  and we wish nothing more than for the ghosts who haunt him to take a hike .  the seasons have changed since an ex-patient shot jaded child psychologist malcolm crowe ( willis ) in the comfort of his own bedroom .  desperate to get his career back on track  even at the expense of his crumbling marriage ( to williams  of rushmore )  malcolm councils the deeply troubled cole ( osment ) .  the preteen displays all the quirks of malcolms would-be killer : scars on his body ; antisocial behaviour ; and the reluctance to reveal a big secret .  only after cole is locked in a closet by some bullies ( and hospitalized as a result ) does he divulge to malcolm  in a spine-tingling scene  that he sees dead people walking among us  all the time .  malcolm assumes  and given his profession  reasonably so  that cole is schizophrenic  not psychic  but the sincerity in coles anguished confession prevents the doctor from taking drastic measures .  he will instead pursue the supernatural angle  becoming a kind of surrogate father to cole ( who lives with his single mother  lynn ( collette ) ) in the process .  the sixth sense has more in common with ghost than poltergeist .   ( though shyamalan does  somewhat unforgiveably  crib the self-rearranging kitchen business from the latter . )  its far more heartwarming than frightening  and the film would be none the worse for wear without its few pulp shocks .  cole attracts the dead for reasons unknown  but theyre not out to harm him  really-they just want to be heard  even if it means scaring the bejesus out of the innocent gradeschooler .  perhaps the apparitions seem more ghastly to us  at first  than they really are because were looking at the situation through the eyes of an eight-year-old .  thats right : willis  for the first time in years  gives up the spotlight to his costar .  we appreciate malcolms domestic dilemma  but we identify with cole  recalling our fears of the bogeyman or the closet monster or the thing under the bed .  both actors deliver immensely likable performances  and their dynamic is manifest .  willis convinces us that hes a doctor  something he was unable to do as a horndog shrink in the overheated color of night .  osment is phenomenal  a true professional who resists mugging for the camera like some child stars with too much experience in television commercials do .  the sixth sense ( atmospherically shot by the silence of the lambs cinematographer  tak fujimoto ) is actually a drama-its spooky  effective ad campaign is misleading .  only because i was expecting something different did i notice-rather  feel-the movies running time  which is just shy of two hours .  the story unfurls slowly but engrossingly ; its unexpected finish is definitely worth the wait .  im not sure said big twist ending is bulletproof  but i admired its audacity .  , POShollywood has really done the whole dracula thing to death ( no pun intended - honest ) .  its a shame  too  because the good count was probably the most frightening out the old b-movie monsters .  i mean  come on .  are people really going to get that scared over a big green guy named frankenstein that moves at a speed of five miles per hour ?  hell no .  and not only was the idea of a vampire frightening as hell  but it also carried with it a kind of sensual feeling as well  not commonly associated with horror films .  and not only has the idea been done too many times  but with the possible exception of from dusk till dawn  has not been done very well lately  either .  this is precisely why it was so much fun for me watching the original nosferatu .  i got to go back to the times when making movies ( even horror movies ) was considered an art form  and not just done to make cash like nowadays .  and that is exactly what this film is ; art .  ive been a horror fan since i was eight years old  and to this day i have not seen any horror film cover the intellectual ground that this film covers .  let me backtrack a minute .  when i say  intellectual ground   i dont mean that nosferatu tackles philosophical questions or anything like that  i just mean that in order for the film to work the way it was intended to  a little bit of thinking is involved .  with most modern slasher movies like friday the 13th and what-not  you can just simply sit back in your chair and be frightened by the gore that is shown .  those movies could have been made by a fifth grader with a good makeup kit ; movies like this require the viewer to actually pay attention and ponder what is happening on the screen .  you see  this movie has barely any violence in it and even less blood or gore .  this is a thinking mans slasher flick .  the  nosferatu  of the title is orlock ( max shreck )  a strange  hermit-like count that  as the film opens  is looking for a new home to buy .  he employs the help of hutter ( gustav von wangenhein )  a real estate salesman ( or something to that effect ) who has a nice home and even a fiancee named ellen ( greta schroeder ) .  upon orders from his boss  hutter treks to the transylvanian mountains to visit orlocks castle and speak to him about his new home ( which just happens to be right next door to hutters ) .  the next morning  he wakes up to find teeth marks on his neck . . . not  really a good sign .  he then discovers through some reading that the count is a  nosferatu   or vampire  one of the undead that feeds off the blood of living humans .  but by the time he pieces this together  he is too late ; orlock has already embarked to hutters hometown via boat .  will hutter reach his destination in time to save his fiancee from the deadly clutches of count orlock ?  the character of orlock is  of course  dracula .  the only only reason his name was changed was because this was an unauthorized account of bram strockers novel .  just thought that was an interesting little side note . . .  probably the only way you will get to see this fine film is by purchasing a copy of arrow entertainments digitally restored cut  now available in stores .  however  this version is quite different than maunaus original masterpiece .  the movie is now sporting a new soundtrack by band type o-negative and color tinting  much like the 1984 version of langs metropolis .  now  i really appreciate what arrow entertainment is trying to do here  bringing a classic like this to the attention of a wider audience that might have otherwise just skipped this one .  but alas  i like watching movies the way they were originally intended to be seen .  but thats just my bag ; you may like the newer  more  modern  version better .  either way  i suggest investing your money in a copy .  if you like what they have done with it  pop it in the vcr and enjoy .  if youre like me  just do what ill do during future viewings ; turn the color all the way down on your television  hit mute  turn on some bach or mozart or whatever  dim the lights and prepare to view what is truly one of the greatest films ever made .  , POSstendhals syndrome : a condition where  in the presence of art  a person becomes engulfed in a painting and hallucinates and may afterwards suffer symptoms such as depression  suicidal behaviour and personality disorder .  grim stuff  to be sure  but the subject of a remarkable film from italys master of the horror thriller dario argento .  boasting an unforgettable soundtrack from the grandfather of film music ennio morricone  the stendhal syndrome is a quite magnificent return to form for argento .  it follows his disappointing american debut trauma ( 1992 )  the patchy opera ( 1987 ) and several mediocre films he produced for young italian director michele soavi in the late 1980s .  based on the novel by graziella magherini  the film stars argentos daughter asia as young roman police inspector anna manni in pursuit of a brutal rapist-killer .  visiting florence to follow up several leads  she is lured by the killer alfredo ( thomas kretschmann ) to an art gallery  a favourite haunt where he hopes to identify exactly who is on his tail .  at the gallery anna is overwhelmed by a painting and faints .  posing as a bystander  alfredo briefly comes to her aid and having now identified his pursuer  a strange game of cat and mouse begins .  a gripping story evolves  and a coherent one  too  which may surprise those familiar with argentos often lumpy narratives .  the stendhal syndrome is not a simple cop-hunting-killer scenario .  it is a disturbing and often compelling study of the central characters psychological disintegration .  the script explores its psycho-sexual themes with intelligence and candour  perhaps too much so for more sensitive viewers .  but as dark as its themes are  the stendhal syndrome emerges as one of the most artful and effective european thrillers of the last ten years .  argento is once again working in his native italy  and he fully exploits the opportunities to use art and architecture for both symbolic statements and as departure points for several brilliant hallucinogenic sequences .  effects whiz sergio stivaletti serves his director well here  and the cinematography by giuseppe rotunno is consistently excellent .  the films opening 20 minutes segues between hallucination  flashback and real-time with tremendous style .  proof that  at his most inspired  argento remains one of the worlds most exhilarating filmmakers .  the cast is generally good  though marred at times by dubbing into english that renders speech all but emotionless .  asia argentos performance is by turns risky  awkward and fascinating .  its a difficult role  and given her relative inexperience on screen she deserves applause for her efforts .  thomas kretschmann is chillingly effective as alfredo  and marco leonardi ( of cinema paradiso  and possibly the most gorgeous looking man in italy ) does okay as annas work colleague and increasingly confused love interest .  but perhaps the stendhal syndromes single most striking element is ennio morricones soundtrack .  active since the 1960s  morricone has scored over 100 films in his career and this must rate as one of his finest efforts .  its mostly a variation on the one theme : a slow circular melody for strings and wordless female vocal possessed with an extraordinary  haunting beauty that lingers long afterwards .  its been three decades since argento and morricone worked together .  this is a long welcome reunion .  if the film has a fault  it is that the last half hour drags a little and the film doesnt quite reach a completely satisfying climax .  but by the closing scenes  the stendhal syndrome has already offered us enough to qualify as one of the very best films of dario argentos career .   * note : see the uncut print from japanese laserdisc if you can .  dubs of this version are available from various video dealers on the world wide web .  , POSclose your eyes for a moment  if you will  and imagine the sound of stephen reas gaelic brogue  silky smooth and irish like a pint of guinness .  a lackadaisical  naughty little schoolboy voice that flirts and gambols .  an acerbic  sing-song metered voice that evokes the startling imagery and language of anthony burgess  a clockwork orange .   a voice that deliciously conjures scenes both porcine and puerile  like those out of  delicatessen   or  the tin drum .   imagine all of that  and youll get a good sense of what you can expect from  the butcher boy .   imagine that and more .  neil jordans latest film  stars  rea in more ways than one .  rea  the accomplished irish actor most notable from his star turn in jordans  the crying game   contributes a restrained and managed performance as da brady  a small town drunk in an unnamed irish community in the 1960s .  but its his wall-to-wall narration as the butcher boy of the title  da bradys son  francis  that makes reas  performance  worth watching  worth listening to .  and thats only half the fun .  playing the young francie brady is newcomer eamonn owens and he is  without a doubt  a revelation .  for as much as reas voiceover permeates almost every scene of  the butcher boy   owens commands virtually every frame .  its impossible to take your eyes off him .  with his crop of carrot-colored hair  ruddy complexion  and overall grubby appearance  francie brady is an unlikely hero  refusing to be done in by his alcoholic  trumpet-playing father  his depressive  suicidal mother  or the neighboring  bespectacled monster known as mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .  in fact  everything was ok until  the nugent  came to town .  now  she poses as much a threat to the safety and security of town bully francie and his best pal joe ( alan boyle ) as the looming commie menace (  the butcher boy  is set at a time when the fear of nuclear obliteration is first and foremost in the minds of many ) .    pigs !  screams mrs . nugent at the brady menagerie .    youre all pigs !   its the start of many a related image .  after ma brady is shipped off to the  garage  for psychiatric observation and da brady downs one bottle of whiskey too many  francie finally loses grip of his fantasy world of cowboys and indians  the lone ranger  and other comicbook characters .  squealing like a stuck pig  francie does  the likes o that  on the nugents living room floor  and is himself whisked away to a very catholic remand home for  boney arsed bogmen   where his ever fertile imagination--and clever chicanery--runneth over .  director jordans vivid treatment of pat mccabes nightmare novel produces a sometimes disturbing  dark comedy littered with surreal touches ( such as sin ? ad oconnor playing the virgin mary ) .  its not as outlandish as the trailers make out ; instead  this remarkable film focuses on the effects external influences have on the friendship between two boys ( schoolboy chums in real life )  allowing us to empathize with their plight in the presence of extraordinary behavior .  its bleak and its black but its fundamentally very funny .  rea talks us through it  beautifully  and owens drags us though it  admirably  and  in tandem with jordans sure hand  theirs are contributions to make  the butcher boy  a film worth savoring .  , POSzero effect gets its title from the main character  daryl zero ( bill pullman )  although we dont understand what it truly means until the very last line of dialogue in the film .  zero is a private investigator  perhaps the best private investigator who ever lived ( at least hed like to think so ) .  however  hes a socially inept being  and eccentric in every possible way -- this fact certainly makes his talents as a private eye even more bewildering than they already are .  zeros accomplice is steve arlo ( ben stiller )  a  normal  guy who does the business side of the job -- hes the one who actually speaks to clients and explains zeros greatness as an investigator .  the opening scene has steve explaining the many virtues of zeros talents to soon-to-be client gregory stark ( ryan oneal ) .  it turns out that stark has lost a key to a safe deposit box  and is now being blackmailed for something that he apparently knows nothing about .  zero takes the case  and the plot thickens .  his path leads to a young  pretty paramedic named gloria sullivan ( kim dickens ) .  despite her luminous and seemingly-harmless presence  she turns out to be the one blackmailing stark .  through his investigations  zero learns why  but not without developing feelings for gloria -- feelings that  because of his reclusive behavior  are new and confusing to him .  i have no particular affinity towards the mystery genre of film .  i can idly enjoy movies about private investigators  and  every once in a while  a film like chinatown comes a long that blows me away ( actually  no private eye film has ever reached chinatowns greatness ) .  zero effect  which is jake kasdans first effort as writer/director  is a film about a private investigator that succeeds in all attempts : its an original  funny  and completely involving motion picture .  with so many cliches available to this genre  i find it amazing that kasdan avoided all of them .  but he didnt just successfully avoid flaws : he has created a great film here  one that had me interested and fascinated from the first shot to the final moment .  take  for starters  the great cast of characters .  pullman is terrific as zero  showing a comic flair that i really havent seen from him since spaceballs .  zero is the kind of guy who seems at ease switching personalities so frequently as he does here ; the fact that hes an almost exaggeratedly twisted  emotionally unstable man outside of his profession is not at all difficult to believe .  pullmans performance is much more layered than it might seem at first glance  and the occasional voice-over as hes going through the motions of his job are insightful and often hilarious .  ben stiller is also a very funny individual ; hes the kind of comedian who makes normal lines sound funny .    ill shoot you   he says to stark at one point .    i have a gun  and everything .   his character is also well-drawn  with an interesting subplot involving his girlfriend ( angela featherstone ) who is not happy with the extensive amounts of time he must spend away from her due to the unpredictability of his job .  oneal also gives his character a bit of depth ; and kim dickens  last seen ( and underused ) in mercury rising  gets a chance to show us her talent here  giving gloria the realism this kind of character really needs .  i find zero effect to be an immensely funny and witty film .  kasdans humor is of the best kind -- soft spoken  and mostly dialogue-driven ( though there are some great visual jokes ) .  its the kind of humor thats funny even after youve seen it five or six times .  theres one scene in which zero talks about how detached he is  an how that makes him such a great detective .  what we see during this narration are various shots of him sitting on a bed  or standing motionlessly  with his hair destroyed and an utterly blank look painted on his unshaven face  his eyes pointing to something off camera  but obviously to nothing in particular .  i cant convey to you how funny this is  but what makes it great film making is that it has a point -- scenes like this are frequent  and they provide solid characterization of zero .  as a side note  i dont consider myself an average viewer when it comes to comedy ( not to sound elitist ) -- i find things funny that many do not  and vice versa .  there was a clump of people near me in the theater laughing uproariously through this film  and the rest of the theater was relatively silent through most of it .  i have a feeling the humor here wont appeal to everyone  but theres certainly enough story and character development to keep anyones interest .  jake kasdan  son of writer/director lawrence kasdan  is only 22 years old .  i found this out after seeing the film  and i cant remember ever being so impressed with a film maker .  his direction is stylish without being pretentious  and his writing is mature  full  and developed .  zero effect is the kind of film that ill buy for my collection -- smart  original films like this are rare as it is  but this one actually has a heart and a soul .  at the end of the film  i was involved in the characters  and i was satisfied with the outcome .  and  with kasdans undeniable talent at such a young age  all i can do is hope to see a lot more from him in the future .  , POSthe long kiss goodnight ( r ) meryl streep tried it and failed .  even pamela anderson lee made an attempt but fell flat on her well-bared assets .  however  geena davis could very well become the first bankable american female action star with the long kiss goodnight  a preposterous but incredibly fun action thriller directed by her husband  renny harlin .  davis plays samantha caine  a mousy suburban school teacher and mother whose memories only go back eight years .  with the help of ethically questionable private detective mitch hennessey ( samuel l . jackson )  she slowly remembers--and reclaims--her past as charly baltimore  tough-as-nails cia operative .  needless to say  with the reappearance of samantha/charly comes the appearance of an assortment of no-goodniks out to erase more than her memory .  shane black netted a cool $4 mil for his script ; im not so sure if his prose is truly deserving of such a hefty price tag  but for what its worth  it delivers the goods .  like blacks previous work  such as lethal weapon and the last boy scout  the script juggles some impressive action scenes with funny  quirky dialogue .  the humor especially works well in this case  for the story is so preposterous that the laughs help to keep things from taking things too seriously .  but theres no argument that the more unbelievable sequences are original and entertaining as hell : who can resist the sight of davis tossing her daughter from a hole in her house into the nearby treehouse or chasing after a car . . .  while ice skating ?  jackson and davis make a good team .  jackson is funny as ever as ever ; in fact  his spirited line deliveries  especially when he first appears  are more than reminiscent of his work as jules in pulp fiction .  as good as he is  the one who should benefit the most from this project is davis  who shows much promise as an action heroine .  what makes her so effective and why she should succeed where streep and lee failed is that she doesnt take herself too seriously .  she is obviously in on the joke  slyly taking jabs at herself and at the situation .  this is not to say that she doesnt need work--sometimes she lays on the  toughness  a bit too thick and comes off too much as a caricature .  but should the public embrace the film and  in turn  the notion of a kick-ass female  davis could have found her special niche .  it seems as if davis and harlins first collaboration  the middling pirate epic cutthroat island  was just a dress rehearsal ( albeit a very costly one ) for long kiss  in which the wife-husband team hit their action stride .  anyone simply looking for a fun  escapist entertainment that requires little-to-no thinking will find this film to be a more-than-welcome kiss .  , POSscreen story by kevin yagher and andrew kevin walker .  screenplay by andrew kevin walker .  inspired by the short story the legend of sleepy hollow by washington irving .  directed by tim burton .  starring johnny depp  christina ricci  and casper van dien .  special appearances by christopher lee and christopher walken .  synopsis : investigator ichabod crane journeys to 1799 sleepy hollow to investigate a series of murders involving decapitation .  townspeople believe the spirit of a dead german mercenary is threatening them .  cute blonde katrina and a listless orphan help crane solve the mystery .  comments : tim burton has directed a number of entertaining and groundbreaking films over the years .  batman  of course  is perhaps his best-known film and led to a string of less successful sequels .  hes done biographical work ( on the director ed wood )  childrens movies ( nightmare before christmas )  and a homage to alien invasion movies ( mars attacks ! ) .  sleepy hollow  his newest feature which fans have been anticipating for a while  shares the similar dark and atmospheric style of his earlier work and counts among his better movies .  sleepy hollow quite obviously draws its inspiration from the old period horror films of the 1950s and 1960s  especially hammer studios reworkings of dracula and frankenstein  and american internationals series of movies based on the works of edgar allan poe .  christopher lee  in fact  star of many hammer productions over the years  appears at the beginning of sleepy hollow as a judge who sends ichabod crane out to investigate the murders .  the movie also borrows from the universal monster movies of the 1930s .  one of the climatic scenes involves a windmill and obviously takes its cue from frankenstein .  i mention these allusions for a reason .  seasoned horror film fans  including myself  will smile at their inclusion in this film .  with the recent disappointments in theatrically released horror movies  especially the blair witch project ( the most overblown turkey of the decade )  we needed a film like this .  not only does it have a sense of history  but burtons skillful use of setting and mood make this an entertaining exercise in horror .  the films eerie landscapes and foggy towns  indeed  overshadow the actors and the plot as the most noteworthy aspect of the movie .  johnny depp  a veteran tim burton actor who has appeared both in ed wood and edward scissorhands  plays ichabod crane  who has apparently changed occupations from irvings original story and is now an investigator .  depp is adequate in his role .  no more ; no less .  equally adequate is christina ricci  who plays the love interest in the film .  shes a good witch too .  how cute .  one of the few weak parts of sleepy hollow is the wooden and cliched dialogue between the main characters .  the two actors  however  carry the movie well enough  but the supporting cast is what makes this movie shine .  veteran actors such as jeffrey jones and michael gough ( who played the butler alfred in all four recent batman flicks ) are terrific as the aging townsfolk involved in the conspiracy which depp uncovers .  while i do not wish to reveal crucial plot points  i can say that the storyline becomes quite confusing .  you have to pay attention .  andrew kevin walker wrote the screenplay .  hes the one who also wrote 8 mm and seven .  walker is quickly becoming one of the premiere suspense writers in hollywood  and sleepy hollow certainly doesnt hurt his growing reputation .  as one might imagine from a gentleman like walker  sleepy hollow is quite graphic .  theres a lot of blood and a lot of beheadings .  this is definately not a flick to take the young kids to .  a lady in front of us took her two young sons to see it and spent about 25 - 30 minutes covering the youngests eyes with her hand .  he was obviously upset by the movies intense violence .  if youre looking for a good scare  however  sleepy hollow is definately recommended .  , POSmpaa : not rated ( though i feel it would likely be pg  for martial-arts violence . )  with three movies already ( re ) released theatrically in america  and at least three more on their way  jackie chan is one of the newest  hot properties  in action adventure stardom  and its just about time .  for over twenty-five years  jackies been starring in martial arts and action movies in hong kong  thrilling audiences with both an incredible grasp of acrobatics and martial arts and a wonderful sense of comedy .    drunken master  has the distinction of being the first jackie chan movie to  make it big  --this is the movie that supposedly set jackie up for big stardom in hong kong .  im not entirely sure why  exactly .  in many ways   drunken master  is similar to most of jackies other early films  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii   master with cracked fingers    half a loaf of kung fu    spiritual kung fu   and others .  in fact  looking at all these early films together  one gets the impression that they were stamped out  cookie-cutter style  at a rate of four to six per year  all using the same casts and telling very similar stories .  to be honest  i think that early jackie chan movies are something of an acquired taste .  theyre quite different from action movies as we know them in america .  these films tend to be set in the chinese countryside in an indeterminate period sometime in the distant past  with fairly slow plots that often meander far afield and sometimes seem to exist only for the intention of stringing comedy and fight scenes together .    drunken master   though its plot is tighter than some  is no exception .   ( as an aside   drunken master  was the first jackie chan movie i ever saw  and i saw it the way it was meant to be seen . . . in  a movie theater in seattle  as part of an asian film festival .  at the time  i didnt really think it was anything special . . . but  after having seen more films like it  its kind of grown on me . )    drunken master  s storyline is very similar to that of other early jackie chan movies  such as  fearless hyena  i and ii and  master with cracked fingers  --slacker martial arts student is taught the martial arts by a harsh-seeming master  and has a big fight with an evil bad guy in the end ( a formula that has been  adapted   to put it kindly  by american films such as karate kid ) .  more specifically  jackie chan plays the part of wong fei-hong  aka  naughty panther   a fun-loving  practical-joking kung fu student who is too good at kung fu for his own good  but not _quite_ good enough .  after embarrassing his instructors assistant by beating him roundly  then beating up a bully in a marketplace  wong fei-hong tries to hit on a pretty girl  but discovers that she  and her mother  can hit back  better than he can . . . and  is further chagrinned to discover that the two women are his cousin and aunt  respectively .  his father  wong kei-ying  is unhappy about this  and is further annoyed when the father and brother of the bully show up to sue for damages .  kei-ying soon institutes a harsh regimen of punishment  which fei-hong does not like at all .  while escaping from this punishment  fei-hong meets up with a drunken old man  who proceeds to thrash him soundly  then take him on as a student and thrash him some more .  this turns out to be su hua-chi  a legendary master of drunken-style kung fu .  he assigns fei-hong a series of bizarre tasks  such as filling jugs with water while hanging upside down from a frame  cracking walnuts with his hands  and other such exercises  that seem like more pointless cruelty but are actually strengthening him up .  then  when hes ready  he teaches him the seven styles of drunken kung fu .  unfortunately  the lazy fei-hong only practices six of them . . .    drunken master  features some wonderful martial arts sequences  with jackie winning some fights and losing others .  its been said before  but ill say it again--these fights dont just _happen_  theyre as carefully choreographed as any ballet performance  and it shows .  in his fights  jackie often makes use of objects found in his environment-- benches  jugs  cups  bowls  fruits and vegetables--often in new and surprising ways .  the fight scenes  particularly those toward the end of the film  are unparallelled in most american films .  whether jackie wins or loses  its really something to see . . . and  its often as funny as anything  too .  and funny is the other thing jackie chan is very  very good at .  theres very little thats new in this movie--jackie winning fights  jackie getting beaten badly by a master  jackie going through punishment or training . . . these  schticks have all been seen before  in any one of several dozen similar jackie movies from the seventies and early eighties .  but theyre still hilarious as ever .  likewise  jackie has a _great_ supporting cast  many of whom were also in other early jackie films  and theyre often the source of plenty of hilarity on their own .  the really big thing about  drunken master   though  that inspired several copycats ( including a couple starring jackie himself ) and a sequel fifteen years later  was the drunken-style kung fu .  im not certain whether or not this is actually a genuine style of kung fu  but the principle behind it is to imitate the wobbly movements of a drunkard to lull the enemy into a false sense of security . . . and  it apparently helps if youre drunk while youre doing it .  genuine or not  i have to admit  theres just something incredibly fun about watching a fellow who looks utterly sloshed wading into a group of startled opponents and making mincemeat out of them before they even realize whats going on .  come to think of it  perhaps this element is what accounts for this films success over any of the other jackie films . . . its  not just martial arts  its the kind of martial arts that makes you stop and go   whoa . . .   on the negative side  the cinematography in this film is nothing special  the film stock is rather primitive  the plot is often rather slow  and the subtitles are sometimes extremely hard to read against the background .    gone with the wind   this isnt .  still  if you like martial arts films  or like what youve seen so far of jackie chan and want to see more  give it a shot .  its much more  real  than chuck norris or jean-claude van damme .  you might very well like it .  another interesting thing about  drunken master  has to do with its video availability in the us .    drunken master  is the only early jackie chan movie that i know of that you can find in its original  letterboxed  hong kong subtitled form  commercially available on vhs ( from magnum video  in a gold box  for about $10 ) .  there are plenty of other early jackie films around  but these are typically either in dubbed  pan-and-scanned form or else import tapes priced for rental instead of purchase .  thankfully   drunken master   at least  is available in the aspect ratio in which it was meant to be seen  at a very affordable price .  if you like  drunken master   take a look at the numerous other early jackie chan films that are out there ( even the dubbed ones arent really _too_ bad . . . if  nothing else  you can enjoy the martial arts choreography while making fun of the dialogue ) .  i particularly recommend  spiritual kung fu    half a loaf of kung fu   the  fearless hyena  movies  and  snake & crane arts of shaolin  .  also  the mostly-unrelated-storywise sequel   drunken master ii   will hit theaters in american release sometime later this year ( though what its american-release title will be is still uncertain ) and comes _highly_ recommended by this reviewer .  also  for a rather different interpretation of the character wong fei-hong ( who is in fact a popular figure from chinese folklore )  ive been told to suggest the  once upon a time in china  series starring jet li ( though i havent personally seen any of them yet ) .  if you choose to watch  drunken master   i really hope you enjoy it  and i hope it starts to open your eyes to the wonderful world of asian cinema thats out there .  all in all  i give this film an .  , POSwell  i know that stallone is 50 years old now  but in daylight he doesnt look it !  daylight is a great disaster movie .  if youve seen cliffhanger  youll know stallones character already .  a guy with a bad past  but is in the right place at the wrong time .  a tunnel connecting new york and new jersey has both sides collapses when a group of robbers collide with a truck carrying * very * flammable toxic waste .  a dozen or so people survive the collapses and the incinerating fireball ( and what a fire ball it was ! )  stallone  a former emergency medical service man  is chauffeuring a rich couple around  when they reach the outside of the tunnel  before the explosion .  then  30 minutes into the movie  boom !  >from here on  the plot takes a back seat  and we are treated to some of the best camera work and action staged .  most all the action is plausible and will hold you at the edge of your seat .  there are a few melodramatic parts here  but  they tend to work out well .  there is no general antagonist in this film  but the action and suspense makes you forget all about that .  daylight is a great film  i saw a non-matinee showing of it  and i thought it was worth every penny .  the characterizations are mostly flat  one dimesional  but they have enough in them to get you to care for some of the characters .  rob cohen ( dragonheart ) does a great job with this film .  , POSlogical time travel movies are a near-impossibility .  considering that the skeptics best argument against the possibility of time travel is the idea of altered realities  writing a script that deals with this problem is an imposing task .  occasionally  we get a film that does manage it .  terry gilliams  12 monkeys  was one such film .  but more frequently  we get films that dont much deal with it at all .  there is one question to ask in this case : does the film have other virtues that override the existing logical inconsistencies ?  the  terminator  films made up for them with exciting action   back to the future  did it with an entertaining story  and the new film  frequency  pulls off the trick with a strong package of its own .  is  frequency  filled with plot holes ?  yes .  does it matter ?  not really .  the film opens in october of 1969 .  firefighter frank sullivan ( dennis quaid ) puts his life on the line every time he suits up for his job  then goes home to his loving wife julia ( elizabeth mitchell ) and son johnny ( daniel henson ) .  the double-pronged story flashes forward to 1999  where johnny ( now jim caviezel ) is all grown up and working as a police detective .  a strange occurrence -- the appearance of aurora borealis over new york city -- allows father and son to communicate through the same ham radio frank used in 69 and that john has found in the present day .  though both are initially skeptical of the idea  john eventually takes this opportunity to warn his father against his impending death in a warehouse fire  and he succeeds in saving frank from certain doom .  now flooded with memories of a full life with his father alive  john is initially overjoyed  until he discovers that the changes to the timeline have been disastrous : a serial killer that would have died has instead lived to kill seven more women .  frank and john now must work together to set things right  with john using the information he has gathered in the future to instruct frank on what to do in the past .  the premise of  frequency  is unusual  and requires getting over one very important mental hurdle to fully accept : john and frank are the only ones conscious of how the timeline has been changed as a result of their actions .  this isnt explained ; you just have to go with it .  when frank doesnt die in a fire  john is the only one who remembers it differently  while everyone else remembers it the new way .  the concept also runs into problems concerning just how synchronous the two realities -- 1969 and 1999 -- are to each other .  sometimes franks changing the past results in something happening right away in johns world  and sometimes john gets the changes ahead of time .  now  the filmmakers might have perfectly good explanations for this  and i could probably come up with something fairly convoluted ( but nevertheless logical ) if i thought about it hard enough ( for example  the reason john gets advance information of the serial killers murders was because the change had already happened in franks world  and john is only witnessing the * projection * of that change )  but explanations arent really the point .  when  frequency  gets cooking  its a riveting little thriller  even if it is confusing .  what matters to a film like this is if the plot makes sense in the moment  and  frequency  works as long as it keeps moving .  the film manages to be engaging despite the logical confusion .  director gregory hoblit and screenwriter toby emmerich structure  frequency  as good hollywood entertainment  establishing decent  likable characters  making us care for them  and setting up a goal to be reached and a conflict to be resolved .  i liked many of the creative touches : the split screens  allowing us to see how the universe is being affected in both realities  and the greater framework of baseball to drive the action forward .  it actually uses the 1969 mets-orioles world series ( the one that featured the amazin mets ) to great effect -- frank uses johns advance knowledge of the series outcome to convince his friends to believe him .   ( admittedly  this device may only be of interest to a baseball fan like myself . )  i even liked the final scene  which features frank and john both fighting the same man simultaneously in different time periods .  some may find this scene blindingly confusing  as the reality shifts start coming fast and furious  but it does make sense if you think about it ( and give the script a lot of leeway )  and lets face it : its a darn cool way to end the film .  there are enough surprises and plot twists in  frequency  to keep you on your toes  and as a result the movie avoids growing stagnant .  the other major thing to appreciate about  frequency  is the handling of the father-son relationship .  quaid and caviezel carry off their parts easily ; its a rock-solid job from both actors .  the relationship is instantly credible because they find the human truth behind the high concept : how would one react to being able to communicate with a dead relative  or with a future descendant ?  watching the exchanges between frank and john will give you a pretty good idea of how to answer that question .  the credibility of the human relationship is absolutely crucial to the rest of the film ; if we dont believe in the characters  we dont care about the outcome of the thriller plot .  here  we do care  because we like the lead actors .  i also liked some of the supporting cast members .  elizabeth mitchell gets stuck with two thankless roles  playing julia the doting wife * and * mother  but still performs admirably .  andre braugher  late of the television show  homicide : life on the street   gives a nice supporting turn as franks best friend and future colleague of john .  he has a lovely scene in a diner in which he tries to explain the situation to julia while franks world series predictions come true before his very eyes .  braugher strikes the perfect facial expression here  simultaneously dismayed and amused .  perhaps the only thing i didnt like about  frequency  is the overly sentimental coda  during which the cameras focus goes a little too soft and the baseball theme gets carried overboard .  but thats only because the film had already earned a poignancy without resorting to cheap tactics .  i freely acknowledge that  frequency  may best work as a  guy  movie  since it focuses on the very male-oriented idea of father-son relationships ( echoes of  field of dreams  can be easily heard )  but the underlying concept is universally applicable .  who wouldnt want to speak with a long-dead parent ?  or see how their children turn out ?    tell me about your life  son  -- excuse me while i mist up .  and dont call me a sissy .  , POSblade is the movie that shows that wesley snipes really can live up to his potential as one of hollywoods premier leading men .  blade is based on the comic book character of the same name and has that comic book kind of feel to it .  it is a very stylish movie and for the most part that style works very well .  although  at a few points i thought i was watching a music video as opposed to a movie .  the ideas behind blade are good  as is the basic plot of the story .  but at times  things seem to get a bit muddled  and the writers appear to want to do too many things at once .  that really doesnt take away from the story too much  but it does hurt it a little bit .  blade ( snipes ) is half man  half vampire .  his mother was bitten by a vampire when she was pregnant with him and as a result he has many of the classic traits of a vampire .  including a thirst for human blood that must be kept under control by a special serum which quenches his blood lust .  blade has spent his life hunting down and killing vampires as a sort of revenge for the fact that one of their kind killed his mother .  but this isnt as easy as it seems  because the vampires in blades world are more sophisticated than the ones that you find in most films .  the government and other authorities know of the existence of vampires  but they let them feast of the population at large because they are taking bribes from the vampires .  where do vampires get money ?  well  in blade  they run multinational companies in order to finance their vampire organizations .  i personally thought that this whole secret corporate world run by vampires to be a very clever idea  and a great addition to the movie .  blade runs up against the evil deacon frost ( stephen dorff ) a maverick in the vampire community .  he isnt content to live among humans  and is convinced that the vampire race is the superior one and he means to insure its superiority .  he has managed to translate the ancient vampire scrolls that tell of the method of making him an all-powerful vampire -- rendering him virtually unstoppable .  its up to blade to see that this doesnt transpire .  admittedly  blade is style over substance through and through .  the story is a relatively forgettable one  but it is fun none the less .  the acting in blade is just about what you would expect from a movie of this type .  this isnt a film that is going to win accolades for its performances  and the actors know this .  the movie is played for fun and nobody seems to think otherwise .  its a popcorn movie  and no one involved has any illusions otherwise .  blades production values are as slick as any that you will find in your typical summer blockbuster .  the combat sequences between blade and his vampire targets are incredibly well done .  although  the mtv-style cuts did get on my nerves after a while during long sequences .  blade is a fun movie with an interesting take on the vampire genre .  this is not the movie for those of you who like your vampires in tuxedos and living in coffins in the basement of some gothic castle .  what blade excels at is bringing the classic lore of the vampire into the next century with a fresh outlook on life .  very cool .  , POSthe truman show ( paramount pictures ) running time : 1 hour 42 minutes starring jim carrey and ed harris directed by peter weir after a long wait  jim carreys dramatic debut finally makes it to the big screen .  in case youve been asleep for the last few months  the plot centres on truman burbank ( carrey ) who leads an seemingly idyllic life in the beautiful town of seahaven .  his life seems so perfect  however  because its controlled by christoff ( harris ) creator of the truman show  the program burbank is unwittingly the hero of .  thats right  burbanks life is being broadcast live to the american public  and seahaven and all its inhabitants are inclosed in a massive sound stage .  the film takes the jerry springer format one step too far . . .  with an idea so different  it would be easy for the director and screenwriter to dumb it down and appeal to the lowest common denominator .  luckily  the film remains sensible enough to appeal to all ages  yet never seems to be a dumb carrey movie .  talking of carrey  hes perfect in this movie  enjoying the best role in his career .  his character is a re-inforced stanley ipkiss from the mask ( 1994 ) and is completely suited to carreys persona .  he occasionally falls into ace ventura mode  shrieking and being silly  but generally the audience is watching subdued carrey .  hes not completely dramatic like the film promises  however .  ed harris brings an extreme intensity to christoff  the megalomaniac creator of the show .  quiet and well spoken  he burns an image into the viewer .  unfortunately  hes barely in the film  and for the first hour dosent appear at all !  also disappointing is natascha mcelhones character sylvia .  she plays the role well  but her character is sadly underwritten and is pushed to the sidelines just when the audience is used to her .  the supporting cast is excellent  and the town of seahaven looks delightfully perfect  so perfect its creepy .  the philip glass soundtrack is also superb  and is used to great effect during the film .  peter weir keeps the film going  clearly having fun .  the film is far more upbeat than his previous films dead poets society and green card .  although it is slightly slow to begin with  about half an hour into film the pace really picks up  and when christoff is introduced fully the film is on a roll .  sadly  though  the film is practically over when the film is in full steam .  also  concerning the ending  it is slightly too ambiguous  which was disappointing .  the screenwriter  andrew niccol  who bought us gattaca ( 1997 ) delivers an entertaining script  and manages to keep the plot in trim .  while christoffs plans to keep truman in do get increasingly silly  they never go over the line  which would have been easy for niccol to do .  also  theres some funny gags involving product placement and the people who watch the show .  overall  the truman show is excellent entertainment .  certainly different from the usual crap hollywood produces  it should be viewed by everyone .  it offers something to every member of the audience  and you would almost certainly not come out disappointed .  overall rating=  review by david wilcock ? 1998    you know  for kids  - norville barnes  , POSno film in recent has left me with such conflicted feelings as neil jordans harrowing  humorous  horrifying adaptation of patrick mccabes novel about young lad francie bradys ( eamonn owens ) descent into madness in 1960s ireland .  on one hand  it was difficult for me to become invested in francies story because he is such an unsavory character  unjustifyably venting his rage at his nosy but otherwise harmless neighbor mrs . nugent ( fiona shaw ) .  on another hand  i found it difficult to laugh at some of francies darkly comic shenanigans because he obviously is such a sick  needy child  having been raised by a drunken father ( stephen rea ) and a suicidal mother ( aisling osullivan ) .  on yet another hand  i also found it difficult to completely sympathize with francie during his more emotional scenes because some of his  for lack of a better word   bad  deeds are so incredibly shocking in their brutality and the malicious glee in which he performs them .  however  the butcher boys power is undeniable  and the film as a whole is unforgettable--perhaps because it is so disturbing .  what makes it so unsettling is the francies overall wink-wink yet matter-of-fact attitude about everything  expressed in a cheeky voiceover narration delivered by the adult francie ( rea again ) .  think heavenly creatures played largely for laughs  and youll sort of understand .  anchoring the whole film is the astonishing debut performance of owens ; love francie or hate him  you cannot take your eyes off of owens .  the butcher boy truly is a twisted  unusual film that is bound to make just about anyone uncomfortable .  in the lobby after the screening  i overheard one man raving about how great yet disturbing it was ; i also heard one particularly offended woman say with disgust   that movie was so unfunny !     i didnt know what to expect .  its like something you chase for so long  but then you dont know how to react when you get it .  i still dont know how to react .   --michael jordan  on winning his first nba championship in 1991 . . . or   my thoughts after meeting him on november 21  1997  , POSjust how inseparable is the team of sgt .  martin riggs ( mel gibson ) and sgt .  roger murtaugh ( danny glover ) ?  lets just say that when one partner asks the other partner to strip to his boxer shorts and then further asks him to run out into the middle of the road  flapping his arms while feverishly cackling like a chicken just to create a distraction  his partner actually does it !  the familiar lethal weapon family is back  including rene russo  who is now the expectant mother of riggs child and joe pesci as the soprana-like  foul-mouthed former accountant who has decided to become a private eye .  new to the team is chris rock  also a fast-talking  up and coming detective .  trouble seems to follow the two veteran detectives where ever they go  and in this film  that is no exception .  even when they are just taking a leisurely boat ride  they somehow manage to collide with a freighter ship .  we here some ominous music  which clues us that a confrontation is about to happen .  gunfire ensues  and when its all over  the detectives want to learn more about this freighter by questioning a chinatown crime lord .  although they dont know what theyre looking for  their inquisitiveness causes the bad guys to take some action .  and theres plenty of action here for two movies .  led by fighting sensation jet li  whose martial arts skill is nothing less than impressive  he does what he can to make sure that no one finds out what they are up to .  li is ruthless in his approach  will kill anyone just to make a point  and develops enormous disdain for the two detectives .  there are terrific car chases  explosions and gunshot galore .  its a summer action recipe followed to the letter  and the result is nothing less than pure  unadulterated summer fun .  but even too many explosions can get boring .  to counter that  we are treated to several amazingly choreographed fight sequences with jet li .  luckily  hed rather fight hand-to-hand instead of firing off guns .  meanwhile  when the detectives arent reloading their guns or running from fireballs  theyre engaged in sophomoric banter and silly conversations that provide a nice diversion from the hail of bullets .  everybody gets in on the shtick .  russo screams during her delivery  the crime lord has a few funny bits when hes being interrogated while being given laughing gas  and pesci and rock are very funny as they go at it discussing the drawbacks of having cellular phones .  gibson and glover are always in sync and the film moves at a brisk pace to get to the final and terrific mano a mano .  score one for the old guard .  , POSsince 1990  the dramatic picture has undergone a certain change of style .  now  instead of emphasizing feel-good stories replete with characters of noble virtues  the screenplays and direction point toward human struggle and sorrow .  this realist tendancy can be inspiring at times  as 1993s schindlers list shows .  most of todays mainstream drama  however  creates an overabundance of emoting that can turn off members of the audience .  thats why pictures like october sky  which are a throwback to the good ol dramas of yesteryear  are such a welcome relief in contemporary cinema .  the movie is based on the true story of homer hickam ( jake gyllenhaal )  a teenager in the 1950s company town of coalwood  west virginia .  its a well-known fact that the only boys to make a name for themselves are the ones that get out of the town on football scholarships ; the rest grow up to work in the coal mine .  the mine  which is run by homers father ( chris cooper )  is not the place for homer  however .  after watching the soviet satellite sputnik shoot across the october sky in 1957  homer feels a connection with the outside world -- as he puts it   anyone in the world could look up and see the same thing i did .   drafting two of his best friends and the brainiac outcast  homer begins to construct rockets .  with the help of their history teacher  miss riley ( laura dern )  and several mine workers  the four are soon bound for great things .  october sky is a skillfully crafted film  and most of that credit must go to director joe johnston .  johnston -- whose career in the film industry includes everything from directing well-known titles like jumanji and the rocketeer down to an uncredited role as a death star trooper in star wars -- certainly knows what hes doing here .  he molds characters which are true to life and also fun to watch into a plot that is straightforward and robust .  he does not push any barriers  but instead adopts a conservative style of filmmaking which enhances the films charm .  his finesse brings out elements which might otherwise be lost -- such as the relationships between homer and various mine workers  or the silent struggle between homers mother and father .  the cast is well chosen  although the true bright spots are the supporting roles .  laura dern ( jurassic park ) lends a strong performance in the role of the history teacher  giving the boys the support and guidance they need .  her role is instantly likeable .  chris cooper ( the horse whisperer )  as homers father  is less likeable -- even downright despicable at times -- but his turn here gives gravity to the movie .  hes definitely a driving force in homers life  and his more humane moments give the piece a certain dynamic that is commendable .  the script is generally cheerful  projecting the boys endeavors in a lighthearted manner .  there are moments when it becomes predictable -- such as the train tracks scene -- and there are moments when it sacrifices orginality for the need to come up with an emotional plot twist .  it highlights the essence of youth  however  and for its exceptional job at this it can be forgiven other missteps .  october sky should be a success with audiences .  although it doesnt have the appeal of current teen flicks like varsity blues or shes all that  it certainly holds an undeniable quality that older crowds will lean towards .  its a welcome change to the dramatic genre  and one that everyone should see .  , POSa big surprise to me .  the good trailer had hinted that they pulled the impossible off  but making a blues brothers movie without jake blues ( john belushi ) is such a dumb idea i really had no hope .  they replaced him just fine .  not with john goodman  he didnt do much of anything  but with the brilliant actor joe morton  who can really sing .  the fourth blues brother is j evan bonifant  whos ten .  this was another of my fears for the film  but hes a really good dancer  and plays a mean harmonica ( although he may have been dubbed ) .  things that intellectually had bothered me before  like no mission from god  everyone being richer  it not being filmed in chicago -- gave me no problems at all .  im quite pleased that there were less car pile-ups  because they meant less music  and john landis seems to have lost interest in the whole thing .  theres a few early crashes  and then one huge pile-up  but after that it all stops .  its just the music .  one of my problems with the first is that cab calloways song is so good the actually blues brothers look dull after him  but theres no problems with this .  the music is all as good as ever  tons of great musicians showing up -- with the exception of johnny lang  who cant sing  all the musicians do a great job .  the only real problems i had was the special effects .  these were superfluous and a waste of money .  since the film isnt doing very well  they could mean we have no possibility of another sequel  which i want to see .  the bluegrass version of riders in the sky is even better than rawhide .  -- http : //www . geocities . com/hollywood/academy/8034/

having heard so many critics describe  return to me  as an old-fashioned hollywood romance  i kept asking myself going into this movie : what exactly is an old-fashioned hollywood romance ?  what made  return to me  old-fashioned and old-hollywood ?  was it the tunes from sinatra  etc .  legendary singers the senior citizens in the film constantly harp on ?  was it the glamorous  sophisticated feel ?  the charisma of the two leads ?  even now i cant say that i have gotten any closer to the real answer  because i havent see that many old-fashioned hollywood romances .  i dont think any of the romances ive seen have been classified as such .  which leaves me the option of vaguely agreeing with my fellow critics --  return to me  was old-fashioned in the sense that it reminded me of the way the younger generation perceive venerated old hollywood magic  the way i perceive cinnamon spice and apple cider .  it was traditional  magical .  we knew it couldnt be too daring  or have any surprising plot twists that many cynical modern romances are apt to throw in .  it was a romance told with such endearing simplicity  tenderness  and love ( from director bonnie hunt ) that it couldnt help but sparkle with charm despite its shortcomings .  the film owes a lot of what it has to bonnie hunts direction .  from the very first birds eye view of chicago  zooming in slowly toward the insignificant bob rueland ( david duchovny )  accompanied by the  return to me  ballad ( by whom ? )  we can tell were in for something sweet .  the scenes between the characters are endearing  truthful  with just a hint of fantasy .  real people dont act that way ; real people arent that nice .  we know all this  and yet we want to believe in these folks existence .  the premise itself seems to have sprung out of a fairytale  but hunts rooting the fairytale in common chicago folk simultaneously lends credit to the scenario and tinges everyday urban life with a hint of the ethereal .  everything is ordinary--yet beautiful--in this film .  >from the festive little family restaurant to grace ( minnie driver ) and bobs wardrobes .  from the eloquent  not-in-a-hurry to progress storyline to the dainty watercolors that grace paints .  from the animal stars to the way all the characters interact on screen -- the most beautiful part .    return to me  has done an excellent job of assembling together a group of actors who blend in effortlessly as a family : the audience has no trouble at all believing that this rambunctious family actually does exist .  we care for them  laugh with them  cry with them ; were concerned that the little boy will pick up cursing from his father .  whatever hunt did  she brought out the naturalism in all of the actors .  disappointingly  david alan griers charlie  however much i like him  was the most flatly-written .  duchovny here does a laudable job of shaking off his fox mulder persona -- with the help of his fellow co-stars rarely do we see any hint of special agent fox mulder .  instead we have a normal guy who when he falls in love shows more delight than fox mulder will show over the span of an entire season of  the x-files .   duchovny  who is excellent at understatement and self-deprecation as an actor showcases his considerable comedic talent on screen .  minnie driver is engaging as always as the sweet  innocent grace with nothing but a good heart to offer .  though an unlikely pair  duchovny and driver gradually warm up to each other as the movie progresses .  while  return to me  functions remarkably as a laugh-out-loud comedy  a romantic scenic tour through chicago  and a tearjerker  the story is set up so the film ends up having nowhere to develop .  the entire climax of the film hinges on when and how grace is going to tell bob that she actually was the recipient of his wifes heart .  we already know that theres going to be a happy ending ; we feel like we spend the entire film  however enjoyably  in a straight line going towards that point .  as a result bob and grace click almost too quickly--yes  i know shes supposed to have his ex-wifes heart and everything--it seems too effortless .  the main subject is a love story  and the family scenes i love so much unfortunately are overused and distract from the turmoil of the two main characters ( whose story might not have that much meat after all ) .  however  in the spirit of  return to me   it wont do to be too picky about how  old  hollywood tells its stories .  i loved knowing that this was a labor of love for bonnie hunt .  it shows .  the bottom line :  return to me  is nothing remarkable  and yet its sweetness  sincerity  and charm might touch your heart in ways that you hadnt imagined .  , POSwild things is a suspenseful thriller starring matt dillon  denise richards  and neve campbell that deals with all the issues ; sex  love  murder  and betrayal .  the setting of the film is a town named blue bay .  it consists of many swamps and slums and  on the other hand  rich estates owned by the towns different benefactors .  the film opens just before the beginning of a senior seminar at the towns ritzy  expensive high school .  it is here that we meet all of the core characters .  theres guidance counselor sam lombardo  police officers ray duquette and gloria perez  dark mysterious senior suzie toller  and the popular head cheerleader kelly van ryan .  we first see that all of the senior girls are smitten with the handsome guidance counselor  but none more than kelly .  throughout the first portion of the film we see how far kelly will go to get sam until she accuses him of rape .  shortly after  suzie  too  confesses that sam raped her as well .  this pushes kellys sex craving mother  sandra  to stop at nothing until sam is convicted .  during the trial  kelly gives a teary confession of how sam raped her .  however  it is later revealed by suzie that sam never raped either of the girls  it was all a vengeful plan against the guidance counselor .  after sam is cleared  kellys mother pays sam a very substantial amount of cash in order for him not to sue her .  it is then revealed that sam  kelly  and suzie were all in on it together .  it is here that the film starts to reveal just who is being honest with each other and who has their own hidden agenda .  matt dillon stars as sam lombardo .  sam is the kind of guy that every woman would like to sink their claws into  and sam obviously knows it and uses it to his own advantage .  he isnt the obvious best of actors  but dillon does give a convincing performance .  however  his talents seem to be rendered useless near the end of the film  making it look as though his character has lost all of his ethics and principles  although he never had many to start out with in the first place .  neve campbell  who most people relate to scream and scream 2  plays blue bay outcast suzie toller .  suzie obviously has some serious issues to deal with which are obvious from her first scene in the film .  campbell is very successful with this character  adding the slightest bit of charm to a seemingly repulsive character and making her fun to watch .  playing kelly van ryan is denise richards .  kelly is your typical  rich  sexy  head cheerleader who thinks she can have any man she choses  like her sexpot mother sandra .  one of the most interesting things about this film is how it compares and contrasts the relationship between kelly and her mother .  denise richards  still hot off the press from starship troopers  gives the most interesting performance in the entire film .  in the beginning  kelly looks to be a paper thin character  but richards adds a little more spice and ultimately makes the character not only sexy  but dominating as well .  kevin bacon gives one of his fair performances as ray duquette .  this character looks to be one of the most boring  predictable in the film .  however  it is a relationship revealed between him and suzie that adds depth to his story .  still  the film doesnt seem to gain much from bacons performance  only his name .  in the supporting cast  theresa russell plays the much oversexed sandra van ryan  daphne rubin-vega gives an unappealing performance as cop gloria perez  and bill murray shines as sams lawyer  ken bowden .  hats off to murray for adding the perfect touch of comedy to the film .  although wild things was displayed by the press as being an erotic thriller  the eroticism  which is portrayed with good taste  is kept to a minimum and focuses more on the plot and the relationships between the characters .  this is truly a very good film worth seeing if your looking for a movie with a thick plot filled with its share of twists .  , POS * * * * * * minor plot spoilers in review * * * * * * * * * * * * no major spoilers are in review * * * * * *  the previous two  alien  films have each had their own unique styles to them .  the ridley scotts alien was very much a stylistic suspense film .  james camerons aliens was much more of an action film .  and i liked each film separately for which it was .  now alien 3 is out .  and it is its own film in the same right that alien and aliens were .  unlike aliens  alien 3 requires that you have seen aliens .  this is very important as the story picks up exactly were aliens left off .  the survivors of the expedition to lv-426 are returning home after battling and beating the aliens .  the climactic fight scene between ripley and the mother alien on the sulaco in aliens left behind one item  an egg .  in the opening sequence we see the egg hatch  find its quarry  which leads to a fire aboard the sulaco when the facehugger is injured  an leads the sulaco to jettison the hypersleep tubes in an escape vessel .  this vessel crash lands on fury 109 .  everyone in the vessel is killed  except ripley .  the facehugger is jettisoned with them and survives the crash .  fury 109 is an ex-mining/maximum security prison .  when closed down  some of the lifer prisoners decided to stay and live out the remaining years on the planet .  all the prisoners are men who have not seen a woman in many years .  ripleys arrival sparks a problem with the inmates .  as for the new haircut that ripley and the prisoners sport  there is an infestation of lice on the planet .  being an ex-prison means that there is no way off the planet and no weapons .  so the prisoners and ripley are off to face the alien on their own .  i will not go into detail  but you can guess what happens here .  the alien is loose and no one believes ripleys outstanding story .  she finds comfort in the arms of the colonys doctor .  yes  after 57 years ripley has sex .  it is not gratuitous  in fact  we dont even see them kiss  but it is just as well .  a sweaty sex scene would not have worked in the context of the film .  there is a lot more gore in alien 3 .  in fact i would guess to say that there is more in alien 3 than either of the earlier two .  it also sports a new alien with 4 legs !  i wont say how  but it leads us to believe a few new things about the alien and its cycle  which i am sure will be explored in alien 4 .  sigourney weaver is back as ripley and provides another excellent performance of this character .  her scene during the autopsy of newt is enough to garnish her another academy nomination .  the rest of the cast is also quite good .  notably  charles dance as the doctor with whom ripley finds momentary escape from fury 109 .  alien 3 has a very distinct look .  this is due largely to its director  david fincher .  mr . fincher  who until now has only directed music videos and commercials  has done an incredible job here .  his direction is excellent and makes this film come to life in ways no  alien  film has before .  for mr . fincher  i see a long prosperous career ahead of him .  the music was also done by a newcomer to the film industry .  elliot goldenthal has created a deeply moving score which lends itself to the claustrophobic setting that the  alien  series been set in .  this time the score is not so much a rip off of star trek ii ( james horners aliens ) .  this score has a choral back up at times and even lends itself to the old style of ennio morricone scoring .  this is a great score .  the ending to alien 3 is quite good .  there were times i thought that hollywood would come in and screw it up  but it played very nicely .  i will not ruin the ending for you .  go see the film .  i consider it to be a much more involved film than any of the other films released so far this season .  alien 3 is a worthy successor to aliens and alien .  and when they make alien 4  perhaps they will be able to find yet another new direction to take it in .  , POSare you tired of all the hot new releases being gone by the time you get to the video store ?  wafflemovies . com is dedicated to finding those hidden gems that lie on the shelves .  everyweek  wafflemovies . com  reviews independent film and big studio pictures that deserve a second chance on video .  here is a sample review :  welcome to sarajevo  in light of americas recent intervention in kosovo  welcome to sarajevo is a reminder of the horror america and the world ignored for years .  set in sarajevo 1992 and based on actual events  this picture examines the human and societal casualties of war .  the picture opens with a family escorting their young bride to her wedding .  as they make their way down the street  a sniper shoots the mother of the bride .  yet another reminder that daily life in war torn sarajevo can never escape the horror of war .  in this scene  we meet joe flynn ( woody harrelson )  an american reporter who stops reporting to help a priest carry the mortally wounded mother into a church .  joe is cocky  but also good at heart as he continues to carry out kind deeds for people he doesnt even know .  his fellow reporter is the british michael henderson ( stephen dillane ) .  michael is quickly growing tired of the horror that surrounds him and the worlds lack of interest .  henderson is haunted by the memory of an altar boy who witnesses the mothers death as well as a young girl who he finds orphaned in a hospital after a mortar attack on citizens waiting in line for bread .  he decides to take action when a united nations delegation descends upon the area to declare yugoslavia the fourteenth most dangerous place on earth .  henderson begins a series profiling an orphanage located on the front lines .  he finds children of all ages living in fear and taking care of each other with the help of one adult .  during his visits  he befriends a pre-teen girl  emira ( emira nuseric ) who serves as surrogate mother to baby roadrunner .  he promises to get emira out of harms way if he gets the chance .  after the un delegation leaves the country without rescuing any of the children  henderson loses hope .  however  his reporting has grabbed the attention of nina ( marisa tomei ) and her childrens aid group that helps to find homes for the yugoslavian orphans .  unfortunately  only babies are wanted for adoption  so henderson pledges to take emira to england .  the group of children  nina and henderson depart the front lines on a dangerous escape for italy .  can they complete this dangerous trek through the war torn countryside and avoid hostile troops gathering up muslims for concentration camps ?  the movie was beautifully and sensitively made .  director michael winterbottom and screenwriter frank cottrell boyce vividly express the societal destruction that has occurred .  they show the destroyed lives  families that have been split up  and the desolation that everyone attempts to cope with .  this is best exemplified by the group of yugoslavians henderson  his producer and flynn have befriended .  the group of twenty-somethings reside in a bombed out bar without lifes simplest pleasures and amenities .  one of them is an accomplished musician who spends his days playing the piano and promising to play a concert when sarajevo is declared the most dangerous place on earth .  like the rest of those deeply effected by the war  this small group tries to survive instead of trying to live .  winterbottom brilliantly intersplices scenes with actual news footage to give the film the feel of a documentary and keeps the viewer aware that many of these horrors are being carried out thousands of miles away as you sit safely in your living room .  the picture is also bolstered by beautiful cinematography that captures the devastation of this city that hosted the 1984 olympics .  winterbottom and boyce also produce a realistic portrayal of the reporters covering the atrocities .  this portrayal is much more flattering to reporters than earlier wafflemovies . com  selection mad city .  we watch them struggle to cover the horror  while trying to remain professionally detached .  however  they are human and question the reason behind it all  why no one cares  and how they can get out .  stephen dillane is wonderful as henderson .  he portrays the character as an everyman caught in the middle of extraordinary events .  dillane avoids making the character overly heroic and preachy .  henderson realizes that he cannot save the world  but he can help a few .  it is a wonderful opportunity for dillane after he had to suffer through the denis leary-sandra bullock disaster two if by sea .  woody harrelson continues to prove that he is one of the finest  most versatile actors of his generation .  harrelson plays the cocky celebrity reporter with a heart of gold by allowing the characters caring nature and vulnerability shine through .  harrelson is equally adept at taking on roles as zany leading men ( cheers  white men cant jump ) as well as excellent supporting roles such as this one .  this ability will serve him well and give him a long  successful career .  americas involvement in this struggle comes seven years after the events of the movie take place .  for those who do not have a full understanding of the history of the conflict  the entire movie  most importantly the opening scenes  provide a history lesson .  war is a foreign concept to most of us in america .  battles are fought thousands of miles away among people we have no attachment to .  televised images of the gulf war are all the experience most of us have with war .  this picture brings it right into your living room and makes you think outside of our own small world  something we dont do enough of in 90s america .  , POSmany people dislike french films for their lack of closure .  while possibly shallow  ive often had a desire for a sense of epiphany  or at least a resolution  in the films which i view .  there is no revelation in un coeur en hiver in the traditional ; however  the film is incredibly successful in its passionate dramatization of a passion-denying protagonist  stephane ( daniel auteuil ) .  stephane ( daniel auteuil ) is a master violin maker .  he is passionless about all that which surrounds him except his craft and the music which his craft is responsible for producing .  even the relationship between he and his boss  maxime ( andre dussollier ) is a controlled  and almost manipulated association  highlighted by the fact that stephane permits maxime to win close squash matches .  in the beginning of the movie  stephane is a closed  solitary individual and the audience is carefully left to wonder about the depth of emotion behind this enigmatic man .  camille kessler ( emmanuelle beart ) is a master violinist and the new love of maximes .  maxime is so much in love with camille that he plans to and does leave his wife .  like stephane  camille is outwardly very controlled and reserved  sacrificing all thought and emotion to her violin and the music which emerges .  when stephane and camille meet  there is a recognition of a bonding by both individuals .  however  whereas camille submits to the wild interplay of emotions which she now feels for stephane  stephane only admits that camille is attracted to him .  stephane ignores his feelings for camille  which the audience cannot help but to see is present .  as the movie progresses  the two characters become more and more polarized in their views and emotions for one another .  these two people  with very similar approaches to life initially  react to their new circumstance very differently .  stephane becomes even more rational and controlled  while camille becomes more tempestuous  until she almost borders on suffering a nervous breakdown due to the inability to consummate their relationship .  however  their approach to each other is perhaps not surprising considering their vocation .  the audience is led to believe that stephane may have been a genius as a violinist as well  due to his relationship with a master violin teacher .  however  apparently  he could not be a violinist due to his intolerance for flaws in his playing .  consequently  stephane becomes a precision craftsmen with the instrument and no longer plays .  in contrast  camille had almost given the violin  years earlier .  however  with the aid of her manager  she has progressed to being almost one of the worlds finest  successfully submerging herself to her playing .  during the course of the movie  we see both characters evolve as they struggle to meet the challenge of their new emotions .  stephane attempts to remain unchanged .  however  we do see subtle hints of his transformation .  one of the most obvious is when he defeats maxime in squash .  the development of all of the characters  many of which is not included in this synopsis  is incredible .  american movies  with rare exceptions  have not and i would daresay cannot approach foreign films in character development .  in its essence  this movie is about the development and growth of the characters  camille and stephane .  the portrayal of all the other characters in the movie  including a death  is to further the development of camilles and stepahnes characters .  i am not sure why berardinelli says   at times it becomes difficult to determine whether stephane should be pitied or vilified  and it is to auteuils credit that he manages to maintain this uncertainty .   this movie is not about judging stephanes actions as being right or wrong  but about viewing their growth and accepting the characters as who they are .  i find the ending appropriate ; unfortunately  i found the last ten minutes which led up to the final scene to be very unfulfilling .  this portion of the film is where the  sense of closure  could have been successfully accomplished .  unfortunately  there is a hurried and almost a soap opera-type surge of emotions from all of the characters .  while ravel may not be quite as accomplished as schubert or mozart  ravel has his day in this film .  the synergism of the tension of ravels music and tension on the screen is the best i have ever seen .  the directing in this movie is wonderful .  the actors and actresses are excellent  each playing their part with great sincerity and warmth .  emmanuelle bearts personality is beautiful .  and needless to say  i must say that emmanuelle beart  herself  is beautiful .  besides the near ending  the only other criticism of the movie which i have is that the movie is almost too cerebral .  i almost left with the sense little happened because almost all the changes which occur in the movie happen in deep in their psyches and little in their personalities or the situations which they end as part of .  the one question which i am left with is while they have accepted their lot  has their attitude towards love changed ?  i have several possibilities which i believe the movie hints at  but i am unsure of which the director is espousing .  in summary  this movie is solely about the character growth of two characters who almost develop a relationship .  in the process  we see their attitude towards life and other people .  in itself  i do not believe un coeur is a complicated movie .  where it does become complicated is when we juxtapose the scenes of the movie into the greater walk of life where we  as americans  have preconceived american notions of relationship  love  and people .  i do wonder how the movie translates when viewed within its native french culture .  however  i  bringing my american preconceptions  enjoyed the film .  i would welcome any comments about this movie from any who have seen it .  , POSthe keen wisdom of an elderly bank robber  the naive ambitions of a sexy hospital nurse  and a partnership that blossoms between the two are the fine components that make up a modest  little caper adventure entitled `where the money is .   the elderly bank robber is henry ( paul newman )  a famous criminal that was only recently caught .  he has pulled off dozens of successful heists and has probably stashed away a small fortune .  always the shrewd thinker  he begins working on a plan to get out of jail .  this involves years of studying buddhism and self-hypnosis .  when he is prepared to execute his plan  he uses what he has learned to fake a stroke .  now a seemingly twitching vegetable  he is temporarily transferred to a state-run home .  carol ( linda fiorentino ) is the nurse that cares for him .  shes a very bright person with a good heart .  yet  her life is a miserable waste of time .  the most exciting thing to do in town is to fix cars .  her days at the hospital facility are spent leading wheelchair calisthenics .  worse  shes in a dead-end relationship with high-school sweetheart wayne ( dylan mcdermott ) .  they became a couple because they were king and queen of the prom .  to her  this made sense long ago .  but now  its a different story .  wayne seems equally bored with his life  but is content enough to stay put .  waynes greatest ambition is to become a night shift supervising foreman .  carol feels as lifeless as many of the other hospital patients  but shes never been anywhere else and doesnt see many other opportunities in life .  however  when henry falls under her care  her outlook begins to change .  the medical reports may state that he suffered a massive stroke .  carol  however  begins to grow suspicious that henry may just be faking it after all .  maybe she can get through to him  and maybe she can learn something about the money that he has stashed away .  the opening 30 minutes are filled with hilarious attempts of carol trying to bring henry ? back to life .   and what are some of carols resuscitation techniques ?  perhaps an erotic lapdance might stir his senses .  if that fails  maybe shell try a little shock therapy by pushing him off a 20-foot high pier into the cold lake below .  when he finally comes out of his state of self-trance  the movies direction changes  though it remains equally if not more entertaining .  carol sees that henry is filled with charisma and self-assuredness .  she is invigorated by his commanding presence and refreshed by his vibrancy .  this  of course  puts wayne in an odd situation .  henry and carols bond grows stronger when they enter into an agreement to rob an armored car .  henry needs this heist because he is unable to retrieve his original stash .  meanwhile  this is carols ticket to a better life .  wayne is uncomfortable with the situation  but helps out nonetheless .  however  his lack of commitment threatens their success .  the heist sequence is suspenseful  well paced  and casts the uneasy feeling that something will horribly go wrong .  `where the money is does more to spotlight newman and fiorentino than it does to showcase a story about a nifty heist .  newman is the real joy of the film  adroitly showing that at age 75  hes still really hot stuff .  he possesses a sly smile  displays a dominating attitude  and a projects a demeanor that is undeniably attractive .  fiorentino is also a fun presence .  you root for her despite her sense of amorality .  sure  she wants to commit robbery and has little compunction about pushing a wheelchair-stricken man into a lake  but we can see that to escape her dead-end world  she needs to do something drastic .  with two charismatic characters such as these  its hard to ignore that `where the money is is where the fun is .  , POSrobert benton has assembled a stellar  mature cast for his latest feature  twilight  a film noir mystery set amid the fading stars of hollywood .  paul newman stars as retired detective harry ross .  harry has spent the last couple of years doing odd jobs for jack and catherine ames ( gene hackman and susan sarandon )  a pair of married actors who have fallen from the limelight .  when jack sends him on a routine delivery job  however  the old instincts kick in .  soon  harry is wading through a mystery where friendships and lives are on the line  and he no longer knows who to trust .  there are plenty of familiar faces throughout twilight  in addition to newman  hackman and sarandon .  james garner plays raymond hope  a former cop and one of harrys best friends .  stockard channing plays verna  harrys former partner  and possibly a former love interest .  reese witherspoon is mel  the distrustful daughter of the ames  and liev schrieber is her scuzzy boyfriend .  giancarlo esposito appears as harrys bumbling detective protigi  and john spencer is a suspicious police captain .  with a cast like that  its almost worth watching twilight just to stargaze .  luckily  theres more to the film than some sort of actors recognition ceremony .  twilight has a solid film noir-ish plot .  it may not have as many twists and turns as some of the classics  but it has much more than a lot of what passes for film these days .  the major cast members all deliver strong performances  as can be expected of their caliber .  however  none of them have that little extra oomph which would make them memorable .  the supporting cast is enjoyable  if a little underdrawn .  stockard channings character  in particular  is a cipher .  theres more to her character than the film takes the time to describe .  its a minor  but irritating  flaw .  with a solid cast  and a good plot  theres a lot to recommend about twilight .  its biggest flaw is actually its short running time .  at a slim 94 minutes  theres a lot of stuff thats packed into an awfully small package .  still  the chance to see newman  sarandon and hackman working together is worth a cramp or two .  , POSwarning : anyone offended by blatant  leering machismo had better avoid this film .  or lots of blood & guts  men against men and mano-et-mano stuff .  in other words  its a walter hill film !  with a john milius script !  i always picture these guys getting together and producing a movie between arm-wrestling matches .  these films always contain male characters i have a very hard time identifying with  probably due to the likelihood that any meeting between them and me would result in my arm being ripped off and then my subsequent death by beating with said limb .  and we got tough guys galore  here ; drug-running banditos by the dozens  all dirty and sweaty and pretty ill-tempered  overall ; a secret task force of army commandos who are in the area to cover-up ( supposedly ) any connection between the government and the drug runners ; and lots of shit-kicking texas dirt farmers whod as soon shoot you between the eyes as look at you .  in particular  we got nick nolte as one hard-ass texas ranger  powers boothe as the drug kingpin  michael ironsides as the leader of the secret army  and rip torn as the local sheriff .  torn is the sympathetic figure of the group ; he smiles before shooting anyone .  as to women . . .  well  ive never seen jane fonda or meryl streep in a walter hill film  and at this rate  i doubt i ever will .  women exist here to look good  comfort the man  and get argued over .  gosh !  just like the old days . . .  frankly  this is a pretty good movie  if you can accept the premise and can take the macho stuff .  the cinematography is excellent  the cast of characters is broad and has texture  the script is quite good  and the film lets you keep up with whats happening yourself  without spelling it out to you .  i appreciate a film that makes me have to think to keep up .  finally  theres lots of sam peckinpah slow-motion shoot-ups .  , POSaccepting his oscar as producer of this years best picture winner  saul zaentz remarked that his cup runneth over .  one could almost say the same about his much-prized film .  rarely is the screen so overflowing with potent imagery  symbolism  ideas and metaphors  complex and literate storytelling  all possessed of an intelligence that invites -- even demands -- constant scrutiny  an acuity of perception and observation that must somehow yield the truth .  in short  the antithesis of all things hollywood .  yet this surfeit of signals is made to serve a rather pale and thinly realized love story whose emotional impact is as dry as a desert wind .  ralph fiennes is the title character  an amnesiac burn victim whose gradual return to memory  and particularly the memory of love  is the ostensible focus of the film .  but despite the use of numerous flashbacks to help put the pieces of this personal puzzle together  we never learn enough about the man to feel much empathy for him .  his emotional life before the story begins is an essential clue that remains withheld .  the same can easily be said for every other character in the film  of which there are too many .  juliette binoches nurse comes as close as this film gets to an emotional heart .  at least we learn early on that she is scarred by the deaths of those close to her  and so we understand why she is eager to escape the company of her comrades in order to seek refuge in the convalescence of a mysterious  disfigured  dying stranger .  even this information is imparted so quickly and in such cursory fashion  however  that it verges on the comical .  with so many characters enjoying so little screen time  the films 160 minutes can be taxing .  yet there is something so captivating about the sensibility behind the camera that i couldnt help but feel that greatness was in the air .  hints of it were everywhere -- in a man who hates ownership but wants desperately to possess his lover ; in ancient cave paintings of swimmers copied casually by a modern-day swimmer in the sahara ; in the way the shifting sands of time obliterate everything more completely than a world war .  there is enough latent meaning to supply college film students with paper topics for years .  but ultimately the emotional truths writer-director anthony minghella was grasping for were never revealed .  in the end  i was left with the impression that i had witnessed quite an oxymoron : a haunting bore .  bore is perhaps too strong a word .  but after drinking in the rich production values  the cup remains only slightly over half-full .  , POSa bleak look at how the boston underworld operates  a film which was based on the best-seller by george v .  higgins .  it is seen through the weary eyes of a 51-year-old  small-time hood  eddie  fingers  coyle ( mitchum ) .  he got the nickname when a mob boss in his underworld element shut the draw on his hand as a punishment .  his current dilemma is that he got caught running illegal booze by truck and faces a 3-5 year stretch in new hampshire  something he feels will be a life sentence for him since he doesnt think he could survive prison at his age .  he is also concerned that his wife and three kids will have to go on welfare .  he could have cut a deal and gotten off  if he turned his boss over to the d . a .  but he figured he would never live if he did that .  he is currently gun-running for a gang of very successful bank robbers led by scalise ( rocco ) .  the masked bank robbers operate by always first going to the bank managers house and holding his family hostage and then they go to the bank and force the manager to open the vault for them or else his family gets it .  on one of the heists  they kill a bank officer who pushes the alarm .  coyles best friend is dillon ( boyle )  a hit man for the mob  working as a bartender .  he is a permanent stoolie for the treasury agents  as an aggressive young agent named foley ( jordan )  who likes to be called uncle  gives dillon breathing room to operate some of his low-level crime activities and to work the bar even though he has a prison record  as long as he keeps getting valuable info from him on things happening with the gangs .  with the sentencing date closing in on him  the already convicted coyle is out on bail and looking for an angle to cut his jail time .  he contacts agent foley and gives him a few inconsequential tips and then decides to do something that goes against his grain .  thinking he made an iron-clad deal with foley to get his sentenced squashed in new hampshire  he gives him the place where a sale of machine guns is going down  knowing full-well the young hustler ( keats ) selling the guns is a lot like he was as a youth and when arrested will be facing a life sentence .  but foley tells him after he arrests the gun-dealer  that new hampshire wants more before they take away his jail sentence  they want him to be a full-time informer .  warning : spoiler follows in next paragraph .  the bank robbers are setup and caught in the act and the mob boss is convinced coyle did it and gives dillon the contract to take care of his friend .  the contemptuous dillon befriends coyle and treats him to a steak dinner and takes him to a bruin hockey game while getting him boozed up .  coyle takes a look at the young bruin star bobby orr from his upper deck seat and says   to be young like that and have his future  hes the greatest hockey player in the world .   dillon then takes the drunken coyle for a long drive and executes him mob-style  having a kid who works for him dump the body in some bad section of boston .  this is a great atmospheric film due to the realistic noir mood it sets  of the hopeless situation the low-level criminals are in  and how they are forced to live with fear and the uncertainty of what horrible thing will happen next .  the city streets are ugly  the gangsters are shown to be capable of any action to defend their own interests  whether it is betrayal or murder .  there is a fatalistic feel about their lives  something robert mitchum wears as easily as others put on a hat .  mitchum gives this film all the intensity and purpose it needs  as it overcomes a thin plot .  it makes you see the characters for what they are without any false sympathy for them .  mitchum is a loser ; and  that he lived so long  is a tribute to his skills as a survivor .  but in the end  he even loses the respect he had among his underworld friends as a standup guy  as he wrestled with his code of honor and lost even that battle .  , POS  footloose  has only one goal in mind : to reel in an audience with cheesy sentiment and feel-good antics .  and i hate to admit it ; i fell for it .  the movie is about a teenager ( bacon ) who moves to a small town from the big city  and discovers that dancing has been banned by the local reverend ( lithgow ) .  he ends up falling for the preachers daughter ( singer ) and showing the whole town what the magic of dance can do .  as mentioned at the beginning of this review   footloose  is an extremely hokey and predictable teen drama .  there are virtually no surprises  and the writing is second-rate .  so why did i enjoy it so much ?  for one thing  the cast is great .  kevin bacon oozes charisma in an early role .  were rooting for him right from the start  and  unlike most films of this genre  bacon doesnt play him as the  rebel without a clue  sort .  yes  he does rebel  but hes also polite when he needs to be .  and he never broods .  the rest of the cast is equally impressive .  john lithgow  seen here playing a normal guy for a change  is playing a man who would normally be a flat out villian .  but lithgow plays him as a concerned father who is trying to do what he feels is best for his daughter .  by the end of the film  we feel a genuine sense of love and understanding between him and the lori singer character .  another nice touch is the music .  we see the parents of the kids complaining that the music they listen to is filled with  sexual innuendos   but thats not true at all .  the title track  performed by kenny loggins  is upbeat and fun .  during the final sequence  i was overcome with the urge to get off the couch and start dancing .  of course  i soon realized that would be a little pathetic .  anyway   footloose  is a charming little surprise .  dont let the premise prevent you from watching it .  it sucked me in  and itll do the same to you .  , POSas i walked out of crouching tiger  hidden dragon i thought to myself that i had had just seen a great film .  with the passage of a few hours i tempered my enthusiasm and started pondering the question of whether a masterpiece must implicitly be a  great  piece of work and viceversa .  attempting to make a distinction may be a matter of splitting hairs .  i avoided a commitment by appealing to etymology .  as the word implies  a masterpiece is any work which embodies the skills of a master .  as such it should suffice to say that it is a product of exceptional quality .  crouching tiger  hidden dragon fits comfortably in that category .  crouching tiger  hidden dragon immerses the viewer in an idealized world of oriental folklore  with the requisite blend of legend  fantasy  magic and mythology .  it is reminiscent of a wagnerian epic with characters which might as well be half-gods - greater than life  purer than life  stronger than life  physically invincible and able to accomplish superhuman feats  but with a human soul that makes them ultimately vulnerable .  all the classic elements of the oriental mystique are thrown into the mix  including the art of contemplation and the concept of martial dexterity as the physical equivalent of spiritual advancement .  the classic struggle between good and evil is the inevitable backdrop  with advanced masters of each and a golden pupil  which must choose between the two .  it is the gifted pupil who  under the influence of the evil master steals the holy grail in the form of a magic sword which is the focus of the conflict at the heart of the legend .  the elements of romance at two different levels of enlightenment ( a pair of masters and a pair of youngsters ) are poignantly represented .  the paradox of oriental restraint existing side by side with all consuming passion in the same breast is projected effectively .  the fight scenes are stunning balletic tours-de-force  not to be taken literally but clearly to be enjoyed as superb cinematic art  as are the prodigious leaps and flights to  from and between rooftops  the martial combat at the top of swaying bamboo branches and the combatants skipping like pebbles along the surface of a lake .  there need be no question of suspended disbelief when one is in the presence of poetry .  as in a wagnerian opera there is a substantial story line  which takes place at an ordinary human level  yet the entire project is to be accepted as a work of art rooted in fantasy .  do not assume  however  that the art is limp-wristed .  for those who are put off by the  art  label this film can be confidently recommended as engrossing entertainment at the levels of adventure  action and romance .  there are no weak performances in this movie .  michelle yeoh imbues her character with depth  humanity and wisdom .  chow yon fat projects dignity and purity of heart .  zhang ziyi is a budding superstar .  she is radiantly beautiful and totally persuasive in a multifaceted role .  cheng pei pei as the evil master and chang cheng as the bandit prince acquit themselves admirably .  kudos to screenwriters james schamus  wang hui ling and tsai kuo jing  choreographer yuen wo-ping  photography director peter pau and music director tan dun  each of which contribute quality components to this extraordinary film .  ang lee as the director  co-producer and mastermind of the project gets the lion share of the credit .  this is destined to be one of those films that everybody likes  including those who hate martial arts movies .  dont miss it .  , POS  crazy/beautiful  suffers from the damned-if-you-do  damned-if-you-dont syndrome .  after a spate of flighty  cookie-cutter teen films  the romantic drama addresses alcoholism and parental loss along with its love story .  but rather than applaud the production  early reviews have dismissed it as an overblown  afterschool special .   even worse  in the wake of federal trade commission hearings that blasted the industry for marketing violent and sexual movies to young people  the studio got a case of the heebie-jeebies and forced director john stockwell to re-shoot scenes and cut footage to  tone things down .   needless to say  the filmmaker was frustrated .    we were trying to make a cautionary tale   he told newsweek   and we couldnt show the behavior we were trying to caution people away from .   regardless  the film works  thanks to exceptional performances from its lead players and a script determined to transcend stereotypes .    crazy/beautiful  is quality fare  good enough that i half-expected the summer movie crap police to walk into the press screening and confiscate the print for  failure to incorporate explosions and poop jokes .   set in pacific palisades  calif .  the story follows the burgeoning relationship between two teens .  every morning and evening  carlos nunez ( jay hernandez ) takes a two-hour bus ride in order to attend pacific high school .  an honor student and star athlete  carlos is responsible  modest and focused as he works on securing a place in the naval academy .  all is well until he meets nicole oakley ( kirsten dunst )  the daughter of a rich congressman ( bruce davison ) .  nicole is a drunk apparently hell-bent on self-destruction .  carlos is smart enough to recognize the danger in getting involved with her  but he is only human and she has the greatest smile .  plus  as her father notes  she has a real knack for drawing others into her downward spiral .  as with  save the last dance    crazy/beautiful  ( god  how i hate lower-case titles ) takes situations that look stale on paper and makes them seem fresh .  while noting the racial and social differences between the kids  the screenplay dances around most of the clich ? s ( there are still several mtv moments  though ) .  the filmmakers make a point to give characters that crucial extra bit of shading that turns them into individuals instead of stereotypes and the actors take it from there .  cute-as-a-button dunst forces the viewer to share the pain beneath nicoles behavior .  she is credible enough that when dad urges carlos to get away from her before she drags him down  i hoped the boy would listen .  as carlos  hernandez is a revelation .  hunky without looking like the product of a hollywood design team  the young man can really act ; we will see a lot of this guy in the future .  aside from its title  the biggest problem with  crazy/beautiful  is its ending  which wraps everything up too fast and too tidy .  after carefully presenting credible characters and situations  the conclusion feels rushed and lazy .  still  this is the kind of film that deserves accolades from critics instead of cheap shots .    afterschool special  my ass ?  crazy/beautiful  is the real deal .  , POSeveryone knows someone like giles death : stuffy  arrogant  set in his ways  and at war with anything that could in any way be associated with  progress .   giles is a writer  but the product of his typewriter is the kind of scholarly stuff that is immediately put onto library stacks where it can gather dust until some graduate student needs another reference for his or her thesis .  his house looks like an immaculate museum ? with no television  microwave  word processor  or other technological gadgets  only the electric lights betray that hes living in the twentieth century  not the nineteenth .  this is the kind of role that could easily be turned into a flat stereotype  but john hurt  in what is certainly his best performance in a decade and possibly the most impressive of his long and distinguished career  turns  erstwhile fogy  giles into a three-dimensional human being .  despite his tunnel vision  its impossible not to like the man  especially after his entire being is transformed by that singular affliction to which no one is immune : love .  and  as giles discovers during the course of this amusing  warm-hearted motion picture  its possible to find the object of ones affection in the most unusual places .  giles  who is a widower and a recluse  does not frequent the cinema  but when he learns that an e . m . forster film is playing at the local theater  he screws up his courage and decides to go .  what he doesnt realize is that the movie house is showing two films : the forster adaptation and a teen exploitation flick called hotpants college ii .  a nonplused giles ends up sitting in a darkened room watching buff male and female bodies in various states of undress .  just as giles is about to leave  however  he notices ronnie bostock ( jason priestley )  and  suddenly  its love at first sight .  giles is enraptured  and the moment hotpants college ii is over  he beings to scour stores for bostock memorabilia  including teen magazines and video tapes .   ( in order to watch those tapes  giles must buy a vcr  but he initially doesnt realize that he needs a tv to use the vcr . )  eventually  not satisfied with being the worlds foremost authority on bostock  giles boards a plane and travels to long island  where his idols home is located .  bostock is away when giles arrives  but the wily englishman manages to befriend ronnies supermodel girlfriend  audrey ( fiona loewi ) .  eventually  the actor arrives home and  impressed with giles demeanor and intelligence  he begins to rely on the older mans advice .  but  while giles affection runs deep  ronnies feelings are less constant .  love and death on long island is a comedy  and a very funny one at that .  in fact  for its first half  the film is nearly-perfect .  it suffers a fall-off once giles reaches new york  and the ending  with its none-too-subtle homosexual overtones  is a little too overbearing for the lighthearted material that precedes it .  in his gently satirical approach to popular culture and movie stardom  writer/director richard kwietniowski  adapting from the novel by gilbert adair  is 100% on- target .  in the process  he not only creates a truly likable and memorable character in giles  but says a few things about the transforming power of love  even if it is unrequited .  from start to finish  this is clearly hurts movie ? hes in almost every frame .  its a role that the veteran actor must have relished  because he makes giles an unforgettable motion picture figure  and does so by means of dialogue delivery  body language  and ever-changing facial expressions .  jason priestley  cashing in on his beverly hills 90210 image  is surprisingly effective as the shallow ronnie .  he is charismatic  and its not hard to understand why giles is attracted to ronnie .  meanwhile  solid support is provided by the appealing fiona loewi and the always-reliable maury chaykin .  love and death on long island is many things wrapped into one : a social commentary ( it tackles the thorny issue of film as pure art versus film as mindless entertainment )  a buddy picture/love story ( ronnie and giles have one of the most interesting relationships found anywhere on a movie screen these days )  and a  fish out of water  tale ( victorian relic giles forced into the modern world ) .  yet  despite the many laughs love and death offers  it never takes cheap shots .  it has a vibrant  beating heart ? and that makes the comedy all the more worthwhile .  , POSfor many people  procrastination isnt a problem to overcome  its a high art .  well do just about anything to put off a task .  when the deadline for this column nears  its the only time during the week dishes get washed and the bed made and laundry done and plants watered and . . .  eventually  hopefully  sometimes  theres a breakthrough and we actually get down to work .  amazingly its almost always easier than we dreaded and after finishing  that sense of oppressive apprehension melts away .  and then  the next time  we do it all again .  english professor grady tripp ( michael douglas ) is a master .  seven years ago  his first book was a hit .  hes been working on his second -- a short 200-page piece -- since then .  fearful that he cant live up to the first  he cant bring himself to finish it .  no writers block  hes nearing 3  000 pages with no end in sight .  now hes having a particularly difficult day .  the colleges annual writers conference is bringing in accomplished novelists reminding tripp that other people are finishing _their_ books .  during the first day  his wife has left him  his married girlfriend informs him shes pregnant and his agent is in town with a six-foot transvestite in tow .  by the evening  our besieged writer is driving though the snow-covered streets of pittsburgh with a suicidal student beside him  a stolen jacket that marilyn monroe wore on her wedding day in the back seat and a murdered blind dog stuffed in the trunk .  this could be a pivotal point in his mid-life crisis .  and then theres the next morning .  theres a lot to like about this movie .  there are no huge explosions  shattering glass or computer-generated dinosaurs to distract from the very real human issues .  grady is caught up in the curse of people who accomplish great things early in their career .  in the world of  what have you done for me lately ?   he knows his second book has to be better than his first .  instead of finding out  he drifts  comfortable in the insular cocoon of academic peter panhood .  he doesnt have much of a life and neither does his star pupil james leer ( tobey maguire ) .  james may be suicidal and psychotic .  certainly everything that comes out of his mouth is a lie .  he makes up a past of working clash anguish because the truth of wealth and comfort just isnt interesting enough .  as the weekend progresses  they are both forced to fully engage life .  thats the question they must face : comfort or real experiences ?  the film takes some interesting chances .  non-traditional relationships are presented as matter-of-fact .  extra-marital  gay  interracial  professor-student : here they arent judged  merely choices .  the actors are all first-rate .  douglas triumphs  playing against type as he spends most of his time disheveled  unshaven and clad in a pink womens house robe .  maguires disengaged alienation works perfectly here .  robert downey jr . as gradys agent livens up his scenes .  director curtis hanson (  l . a .  confidential  ) makes a few missteps .  the women are underused .  frances mcdormand does a good job of her limited role of sara  gradys married lover but we never understand much of who she is .  the chemistry between the two of them is non-existent which makes some of the ending unconvincing .  katie holmes is a student with a major crush on the professor  but her character goes nowhere .  we never even see gradys exiting wife .  this is very much a guys film .  the varied relationships between the men are much more convincing than any of the others .  gradys alternating mentoring and rejection of james is the centerpoint of the film  not him and sara .  as the boomers age  expect to see more mid-life crisis films to catch the attention of that demographic .  eventually itll probably become cliche  but right now weve got a winner .  ill finish this in a second .  right now i have to grab some paint .  i noticed some trim in the other room that needs a little touch-up .   ( michael redman has written this column for so long that hes made mid-life crisis a career choice . )  , POSmeet joe black ( reviewed on nov . 27/98 )  starring brad pitt  anthony hopkins  claire forlani  in  meet joe black   brad pitt plays death .  thats all that really needs to be said  but nevertheless  i will provide the three of you that have seemingly been living in a cave with a plot description .  death decides to take a holiday  what with all the rigors of soul-collecting and all  and forces anthony hopkins into showing him what its like to be human .  death assumes the body of brad pitt  and from there  much trouble ensues .  for one thing  death-as-pitt falls in love with hopkins daughter  played by claire forlani .  obviously this enrages hopkins  because really  what can death offer ?  besides eternal damnation  of course .  there is also a sub-plot about forlanis ex-boyfriend ( she dumps him for pitt ) trying to take over hopkins company .    meet joe black  runs just under three hours .  ive always thought that such obscene running times should be limited to historical epics .    meet joe black  is neither historical nor is it an epic  though i get the feeling martin brest ( the director ) desperately wants it to be .  every single scene in the movie goes on about 3-4 minutes too long .  and the ending takes about 20 minutes longer than it really should .  a severe editing job could have made this movie excellent  instead of just good  which is what it is .  pitt  an actor i normally loathe  is actually quite engaging as death .  i believed his performance  and i could see why forlanis character would fall in love with him .  i have to agree with roger ebert  though  who found it hard to believe that an entity thats been around for all time wouldnt know what peanut butter was .  that has nothing to do with pitts performance  of course  but it is a little distracting .  hopkins gives his usual excellent performance .  hes able to portray the angst of a man who knows he has very little time left  without making him an obnoxious whiner .  and in her first major studio role  claire forlani is surprisingly good .  she has a sweet tenderness that allows the audience to instantly root for her .  so   meet joe black  is a good movie hampered by its ridiculous running time .  had the film been cut by an hour or so  i have no doubt that i would be calling it one of the best movies of the year in this review .  , POScall it touched by a demon .  gregory hoblits fallen is a serial killer movie with an unusual  horrific twist .  if marketed properly  this film could have crossover appeal for both those who appreciate supernatural tales like the prophesy and those who crave grim  dark thrillers like silence of the lambs and seven .  in fact  theres even a little twin peaks to be found here  albeit with the lions share of the weirdness distilled out .   ( remember bob ? )  the biggest failing of fallen is that  although its consistently interesting  its not always as edgy and suspenseful as one might hope .  a serial killer ( elias koteas ) has been on the loose in philadephia  but detective john hobbes ( denzel washington )  the noblest man on the police force  has brought him to justice .  now  during his last hours on death row awaiting his inevitable date with the gas chamber  the mass murderer cryptically tells hobbes   what goes around really goes around .   shortly thereafter  he begins to sing  time is on my side  as hes taken on his last walk .  minutes later  the state of pennsylvania has carried out the execution and edgar reese is dead .  but for hobbes  the nightmare is just beginning  because reese wasnt a normal psychopath ? he was the host body for a mythical dark angel named azazel .  and  with reeses death  azazel is free to hop from body to body  murdering and wreaking havoc at will .  only hobbes and a pretty  female theology teacher ( embeth davidtz ) have an inkling of what theyre up against .  the rest of the cops  including hobbes partner  jonesy ( john goodman ) ; lou ( james gandolfini )  a newcomer to the department ; and lieutenant stanton ( donald sutherland )  dont have a clue  and  as a result  they are in mortal danger .  as depicted by hoblit ( primal fear ) and cinematographer newton thomas sigel  philadelphia is a dark  dreary place ? a gothic city rather than a modern one .  no skyscrapers or other monoliths of current architecture or technology are shown .  the most famous landmark to appear isnt the liberty bell or independence hall ; its genos steaks .  shadows and night scenes abound .  the days are cloudy and unpromising .  this is the kind of setting where its easy to believe that fallen angels walk among men .  fallens plot is brimming with potential  not all of which is realized .  somehow  i would have expected a more frightening tale to emerge from something with this kind of premise .  but the level of terror  like that of gore  is kept in check .  nevertheless  there are several creepily effective scenes as the spirit of azazel moves from body to body when people bump against each other on crowded city sidewalks .  the film also boasts a chase sequence of a kind that can best be described as unusual .  of the several dozen actors to play azazel  the best is by far elias koteas ( exotica  crash )  who  despite only being on screen for about ten minutes  gives a fantastically charged performance .  john goodman also seems to be enjoying himself  although his role for most of the film is relegated to that of a burly sidekick .  sadly  however  these two are the only ones who excel .  everyone else  including denzel washington  is boring .  washingtons flat performance is the most disappointing surprise of the film .  its not that hes bad per se  but hes not very interesting .  theres no real sense of vulnerability or desperation in the way he portrays his character  and that keeps us distanced  however slightly  from hobbes .  as circumstances become progressively more dire for the cop  and as his life-or-death chess game with azazel approaches the point of checkmate  i expected to be more on the edge of my seat than i was .  washingtons subdued approach is part of the reason for this ; i never felt a sense of urgency .  however  at least washington was believable  which is more than can be said for embeth davidtz ( schindlers list ) and donald sutherland .  to be fair  the flaws in their characters arent all acting-related ; neither stanton nor gretta milano are well-written .  that said  however  theres nothing inspired about either davidtzs or sutherlands work .  both appear to be sleepwalking their way through the parts  as if they know that their contribution to the film is one of advancing the plot rather than developing a multi-dimensional individual .  narratively  fallen has a few glaring weaknesses .  although the plot proceeds with a convoluted  game-like structure  it uses a denzel washington-supplied voiceover to overexplain matters .  at times  this is actually helpful  and it has a use beyond the obvious  but there are occasions when ponderous lines like  i like the night ? sometimes you come face to face with yourself  become a little hard to swallow .  in addition  fallen is saddled with the same kind of disgustingly bland  generic theology embraced by numerous movies and tv shows like touched by an angel .  however  despite the negatives  im still recommending fallen on the strength of its complex plot and especially its ending  which i loved .  the final scenes are startling  audacious  and unexpected .  its not often that a plot development takes me by surprise the way this one did .  at a time when most movies fall apart in the last ten minutes  fallen manages to buck the trend and redeem itself .  this is not a great motion picture  but  considering how bad most january releases are  its a reasonably entertaining way to spend two hours .  and  whatever you do  dont walk out on the film before the end credits have begun to roll .  , POSjames l . brooks  one of the developers of the simpsons and director of broadcast news  returns to the big screen with this entertaining  if slightly flawed comedy .  nicholson plays melvin udall  probably the most horrible person ever on the screen .  hes racist  homophobic  and never has a good word to say to anyone .  so  nobody talks to him  except waitress carol conelly ( t . v  sitcom star hunt  who was last seen in twister  1996 ) .  naturally  udall  conelly and gay neighbor simon bishop ( kinnear ) who nicholson hates  all hit it off in the end .  like good will hunting ( 1997 ) and titanic ( 1997 )  even though the outcome is completely obvious  as good as it gets is an enjoyable  funny and warm comedy .  nicholson is hilarious as melvin  churning out insults with superb relish .  only nicholson could get away with the lines that melvin delivers .  hunt is also good as waitress carol  and easily rises to the challenge of nicholson .  theres also ( thankfully ) a bit of chemistry between them .  kinnear  as the gay neighbor  seems to have a slightly underwritten role  hes more of a plot convience than a character .  although his performance is good  his character just seems to exist to help melvin and carol come together .  in fact  the scene stealer is simons dog  who is funnier than nicholson .  but then again  pets are always cute on screen .  providing solid support is cuba gooding  jnr ( jerry maguire  1996 ) and yeardly smith ( who is the voice of lisa simpsons in the simpsons ) although gooding isnt as good as is character in maguire  he is still fun .  he overacts a little  but not so much as to be annoying .  smith is also good  although she has a fairly small role .  even director lawrence kasdan ( body heat  1981 ) makes an appearance as a doctor .  but this is primarily nicholsons film  and every scene hes in  hes steals it .  hes character is so hateful  though  its amazing that anyone talks to him at all  especially carol .  and this is the films main problem .  its totally unbelievable that carol would ever consider liking melvin .  she doesnt fall in love with him naturally  the film forces her to fall in love with him .  also  melvins character seems to go too nice  too quickly .  i would doubt anyone with a character like melvins would be able to turn back to a nice  loving person .  it would take a helluva long time  much longer than this film would like to make out .  brooks direction is good  though  if a bit average  but he usually manages to get an emotion out of the audience .  he handles the comedy scenes better than the sentimental ones ( he tends to pile on to much schmaltz ) but generally hes good .  theres also a nice soundtrack by veteran composer hans zimmer .  but  generally  as good as it gets achieves what it sets out to do  which is to make the audience feel good by the end of the movie .  the movie is a bit overlong  but nicholson is such good fun that the running time passes by pretty quickly .  overall  as good as it gets is a fun movie  even though it may be unbelivable  and certainly worth seeing ( if just for jack nicholsons performance . )  not quite as good as it gets ( pardon the bad joke )  but still good fun .  , POSafter a stylistic detour with mrs .  parker and the vicious circle ( which  despite its uncomfortable tone  was close to being a conventional movie )  director alan rudolph has returned to his unique brand of film making with afterglow  a romantic black comedy about love  betrayal  and self-absorption .  while these may not be the most unusual themes to fashion into a motion picture  rudolphs atypical approach to the characters and their situations makes for an intriguing  if not always pleasant  movie .  it is said that rudolph is a polarizing director ? meaning that most viewers either love his work or hate it .  until mrs .  parker  i had not been overly impressed by his movies .  i found equinox  his last pre- mrs .  parker effort  to be irritating and frustrating .  i was somewhat surprised  therefore  to discover that i liked afterglow .  there are several reasons for this  but the paramount one is that rudolph seems to have muted some of the most strident  mannered aspects of his approach .  the characters here are more like real people with genuine problems  the story is absorbing  and the acting is top-notch .  in short  rudolph has created a world that its worth spending two hours in .  afterglow introduces us to two unhappily married couples .  jeffrey byron ( jonny lee miller ) is a cold  seemingly-heartless businessman who is sexually indifferent to his young wife  marianne ( lara flynn boyle ) .  for her part  marianne is so obsessed with having a baby that she never attempts to interact with her husband on a human level .  all shes interested in is seducing him during those few days when shes ovulating .  after he refuses to make love  she decides to find someone else to play the role of sperm donor .  the other couple  lucky ( nick nolte ) and phyllis mann ( julie christie )  are an older pair  but theyre no more content than jeffrey and marianne .  a mysterious fracture in their past relationship has driven them apart .  they remain married as a matter of convenience  but  since phyllis wont allow lucky to touch her  they have an unspoken agreement whereby he can fool around as much as he wants provided that no lasting bond is established as a result of these affairs .  the landscape of emotional pain between them is palpable .  the four characters begin interacting when marianne hires lucky as a handyman to fix up the inside of the apartment she shares with jeffrey .  the two of them are immediately attracted to one another  and it doesnt take long before theyre lounging together  naked  in her pool .  meanwhile  jeffrey  who is captivated by older women  runs into phyllis in a hotel bar  is smitten  and invites her to accompany him on a weekend retreat to the mountains .  the romantic couplings of the characters are interesting in that they illustrate the multiple faces of love .  sex means something different to everyone ? to jeffrey  its an unpleasant chore  a loss of control ; to marianne  its a means to a maternal end ; to lucky  its an enjoyable distraction that blocks out his marital troubles ; and to phyllis  its a method of establishing or denying emotional closeness .  ultimately  none of these characters appears to love anyone else as much as they love themselves .  the greatest strength of the film lies not in the script  but in the performances .  jonny lee miller is perfect as the selfish  callous  suit-and-tie businessman .  those who recall him as sickboy in trainspotting will find that he is almost unrecognizable here as the image of conformity .  lara flynn boyle  who wasnt impressive in rudolphs equinox  is greatly improved  making marianne a jumble of sexiness and vulnerability .  nick nolte is delightful as the uninhibited lucky  and he manages to deliver some of rudolphs most pregnant lines with practiced ease .  the clear standout  however  is julie christie  who is nothing short of delicious as the world-weary phyllis .  her often wry  occasionally cutting asides are the source of much of the films humor  and theres hardly ever a moment when she doesnt steal the spotlight from her co-stars .  i dont know if afterglow is the film to convert rudolph- detractors  but it seems that this movie is a little more accessible than some of the directors earlier productions .  enough of his trademark style remains  however  to reassure his supporters .  afterglow is basically a four-pronged character study .  the plot is not especially compelling  but the character interaction is  and thats the real reason to see this motion picture .  rudolph has painted an able picture of the non-romantic side of love -- the one that has more to do with tolerance and familiarity than with affection and attraction .  , POS  the fugitive  is probably one of the greatest thrillers ever made .  it takes realistic  believable characters and tells an exciting story thats totally believable throughout .  this isnt an over-the-top action flick for the sake of action  this is an intelligent adventure story with a real sense of mystery to it and it works perfectly .  harrison ford stars as dr . richard kimble  a man who is wrongly accused and convicted of murdering his wife .  the entire premise of the story revolves around this murder  but is not told in a straightforward manner .  we constantly see flashbacks to the murder from kimbles perspective .  hints are dropped from various times of the night kimbles wife  helen ( sela ward ) was murdered .  we dont get to see who the killer is until much further into the story .  in fact  we might even have a little doubt about kimbles innocence ourselves .  the film doesnt spend much time on the details of kimbles trial and conviction as it is not the point of the story .  one of the greatest action scenes ensues as we get a botched escape attempt by his fellow inmates which leads to a fantastic train wreck .  but it does not at all seem gratuitous or formulated  it is actually suspenseful to watch .  this movie is so incredible because its able to take elements like these and make them wholly original and believable .  tommy lee jones almost steals the show as deputy sam gerard  a u . s . marshall who is an expert in hunting fugitives .  from the moment he appears we know a huge game of cat and mouse is about to occur .  kimble and gerard are equally matched as there is no way to tell how one is going to outsmart the other .  most of the film deals with richards complex investigation as he tries to find the one-armed man who killed his wife .  ford does not have a lot of lines here  so it is stuart and twohys script and daviss outstanding direction that make the film as great as it is .  just watching richard use his keen intelligence and wits  disguising himself  and doing his own detective work is very interesting .  we know just as little as he does as to why his wife was killed  so as he learns more so do we .  meanwhile gerard and his staff are using all their skills to hunt him down .  at one point they run into each other and a great chase ensues  but richard is just too smart for them .  he leaves clues for gerard to show his innocence and to help him solve the mystery .  one of the greatest charms to the film is its sense of humor .  there is a great sense of comradeship between gerard and his two closest deputies cosmo renfo ( pantoliano ) and biggs ( roebuck ) .  they are trying to catch what they believe to be a dangerous murderer  yet they constantly start up small talk with each other  making funny wisecracks and one-liners  but not in any kind of distracting manner .  the final act concludes with another terrific chase .  richard figures out who the killer is and confronts him  and although we get a typical fight scene  the case is far from solved .  the man who ordered the murder has been under our nose all along  and we dont realize this until the end when both richard and gerard put the pieces together .  maybe the finally scene is a bit much  but it still has a believable atmosphere to it .  were so relieved when justice is served .  its not the plot is that makes  the fugitive  great  its all the motions the characters go through to make for an intriguing story .  watching a seemingly average man go through as much as this is what makes the movie so adventurous .  if only hollywood could produce more movies like this .   ( 10/31/96 ) ( 1/29/97 ) ( 6/13/97 ) [see also :  nick of time  ]  , POSi think that any competent member of the human race whos ever seen a movie--any movie--could probably predict just about every turn in the wedding singer .  even though i try very hard to not predict films as im watching them ( especially not romantic comedies )  the plot of this particular film just advanced before me seconds  and sometimes minutes  before i actually saw it happen on screen .  but i dont care .  not even a little .  my reasons for this are simple : 1 ) adam sandler is great .  2 ) drew barrymore is great .  3 ) the movie is so funny .  there are parts that left me gasping for air because i was laughing so hard .  i havent laughed this hard in a movie since austin powers .  sandler plays robby hart  a wedding singer who once had dreams of being in a rock band and writing his own music .  in the opening scenes  he seems like a happy-go-lucky wedding singer  at least partially enjoying his profession and doing a rather good job of talking down a really drunk individual ( steve buscemi ) who decides that his brothers wedding is a good place to tell the whole world that his life  up to that point  was utter pointlessness .  a week later  at his own wedding  he is left standing at the altar by his ex-fianc ? e  linda ( angela featherstone ) .  with his life in complete disarray  he meets julia ( barrymore )  a waitress .  she is engaged to glenn ( matthew glave )  and is to marry him in about three months .  julia and robby become good friends when she enlists him to help with the wedding plans .  soon ( and predictably ) it becomes pretty clear that glenn is a jerk  and that robby and julia really love each other .  oh sure  its trite .  and if anyone making this film expected us to  like  feel suspense or something while watching the wedding singer  then they truly underestimated their audience .  what makes the story bearable  aside from the terrific costumes and 80s music  are the performances .  barrymore is simply adorable here ( ive never seen her look so close to the way she did in et ) .  not only is she pleasant to look at  but her acting job here really is a good one--and it doesnt hurt that the character is likable and adequately well-written .  and the jerk  played in full-force by graves  is just as despicable as any villain in any romantic comedy ive ever seen .  naturally  the true star here is sandler .  i think the guy is flat-out hilarious .  he can say something that just isnt funny  and his delivery makes me laugh .  his comedic performance here equals that of happy gilmore  but in this film he goes much further and proves to me that he can  indeed  hold his own as a leading man in a romantic comedy .  whereas his roles in his previous films kind of had sandler playing sandler  the wedding singer gives him a character that  for the first time  he actually has to fit into .  as far as im concerned he succeeded  and this film is testimony that he does  in fact  have some range in his talents .  and the movie is just so funny .  perhaps the best moment is when he sings a song for julia that he claims is a little uneven because he began writing it while in a good mood and finished it after his fianc ? e abandoned him .  this is the part that literally had me groping for a breath of air .  and while the film  like all romantic comedies  takes a hiatus from laughs towards the end because the plot has to finish up  there are more than enough truly hilarious moments in the first hour that make up for any slumps in progress during the second half .  my formal complaints for the wedding singer arent very important .  the film is predicable  but who cares ?  the characters are extremely likable  the movie is ridiculously funny  and the experience is simply enjoyable .  in addition to this  i cant imagine anyone seeing the preview and not wanting to see the film .  in that order  i conclude that it is pointless for me to even have written this review .  i just want everyone to know that i laughed .  a lot .  , POSbased on the boris karloffs classic by the same name  the mummy starts off with the high-priest of osiris  imhotep  who murders the pharoah for his mistress and is punished by being mummified in the most horrifying way possible -- bandaged up  having his tongue removed  and being covered in flesh-eating scarab beetles  then entombed . . . all while still alive .  recap a few thousand years later  where a soldier named rick ( played by brandan fraser ) aids a young historian named evelyn ( played by rachel wiesz ) and her brother  jonathan ( played by john hannah ) in finding the book of amon ra  in the process inadvertently freeing the mummy .  problem is that the mummy wants to revive his mistress  using evelyn as a sacrifice . . .  walking in with relatively low expectations  i thought this movie was actually pretty good .  the visuals and cgi are astounding  and obviously not cheaply done at all .  they pack a ton of detail into the images  especially during scenes involving mummies rendered completely by cgi .  the computer special effects makes for some brilliant scenes  such as unnerving moments involving flesh-eating scarab beetles and moments where the mummy goes after the people who freed him ( after all  those who took his artifacts are cursed ) .  unfortunately  the film attempts to be way too much in such a short span of time  becoming a tug of war for control between genres .  on one hand  it is a fast paced action film .  on the other  its a frightening horror film .  and on the side  its a hilarious comedy .  ideally  for it to be successful  the film would have to focus on one the more action oriented aspect  with one character serving as the comic relief ( that would be johnson ) .  the problem with this film is that it has at least three characters serving as comic relief  with rick occasionally delivering his witty one-liner .  if they were trying to make a horror-action-comedy  it would have helped if it were established early on in the film  but unfortunately  with the backstory of imhoteps entombment  that would be impossible .  and then theres the slapstick fight scene between a sword-wielding rick and an army of mummies .  while really well done  it had the feel of slapstick comedy .  replace the sword with a chainsaw and youd effectively have ash fighting zombies in army of darkness .  while entertaining and funny  it feels really out of place .  but at least its a break from the naive heroes that brendan fraser has been playing a lot of .  on the whole  the movie is pure popcorn fare from beginning to end  entertaining the audience .  but i must end my review with a plea to movie theatre owners . . . turn  the sound down !  while a lot of theatres have good sound systems  my ears were almost ringing as i walked out of the theatre ( the sound is particularly irritating and will make you crap your pants if youre not careful ) .  when they were showing the trailer for the upcoming schwarzenegger film   end of days   it was so loud i couldnt make anything out .  , POSon re-watching italian writer/director dario argentos much lauded murder mystery tenebrae  i was struck more than anything else by how many sins he commits as a storyteller and manages to get away with .  in emphasising style over matters of plot argento is somewhat notorious in cult film circles  but some aficionados still praise tenebrae as the greatest of his  giallo  murder mysteries .  while its certainly not perfect  repeated viewings reveal it to be nonetheless a densely plotted and terrifically stylish thriller .  the story follows a promotional visit to rome by famous american mystery novelist peter neal ( anthony franciosa ) where he discovers that a serial killer is on the loose inspired by his latest book  tenebrae  .  with the police on his back for leads  he decides to take a personal interest in the case and he soon becomes drawn into a mystery where all is not as it seems .  the film benefits enormously from a fine central performance by franciosa .  he brings grace  charm and a deceptive benigness to his character which provides an interesting foil to both the violence of the books he writes and the unfolding real-life horror around him .  the film is awash with a fascinating psychosexual tension .  argento peels back the facade of showbiz and jetset lifestyles to reveal an amoral  ambivalent  shadowy world where desire in all its forms has become a dangerous business .  tenebrae is perhaps the most multi-layered of argentos scripts to date and there is much bubbling underneath the surface here .  it may take at least two or three viewings to appreciate all the psychological themes at play .  in that respect it strongly recalls his previous giallo deep red/profondo rosso ( the full-length italian language version ) and fans will enjoy spotting the recurring themes .  needless to say for argento fans  there is no denying the directors brilliance as a stylist .  many of the action and murder sequences are directed with his characteristic finesse and feature plenty of intriguing camerawork .  they are all the more impressive for the fact that in this film argento creates mood by filling his scenes with light  rather than the dark shadows and deep rich colours of earlier works like deep red and suspiria .  instead  tenebraes set design and lighting paints a sleek  clinical  chilly vision of a vaguely futuristic urban world .  and the soundtracks mix of electronic atmospheres and gothic rock by frequent argento collaborators goblin is the perfect accompaniment .  so tenebrae has much to recommend it  no question .  still  constantly nagging at the back of this viewers mind is several lumps in the narrative .  some critics argue that logic doesnt matter in argento films  but damnit  it matters in all films to the point where viewers dont deserve to feel cheated .  by the way  if you dont want to know the solution to the mystery then skip the next three paragraphs .  about an hour into tenebrae the story takes an unexpected twist which  properly handled  could have proved ingenious .  we witness the murder of the serial killer himself by a man who  we later discover  is none other than the author peter neal .  he is insane  apparently .  the murders then continue for the remainder of the film as neal decides its time to settle some personal business involving his neurotic wife .  he is finally revealed to us as this  second killer  in the films bloody climax .  but argento muffs the twist  both technically and narratively .  you see  we are supposed to be tricked into thinking that during this scene peter neal is actually an innocent witness who was crouching in the bushes nearby the whole time and spying on the killers house .  but thanks to poor editing  its had to believe neal could have murdered the killer anyway .  bad cutting puts the timing way out .  in other words  hes almost in two places at once .  during this crucial scene we are also thrown a ridiculous red herring .  by the films end you realise that for the sake of an alibi neal must have self-inflicted a nasty injury in this earlier scene to make it look like he was attacked by a fleeing assailant .  the injury ?  he banged himself on the head with a bloody great rock !  thus  the revelation of the  hero  as a killer ( and anti-hero ) in the final scenes may still prove shocking  but its all somewhat implausible by the time the end credits have rolled .  helpfully  in the end we do learn that the bizarre flashbacks of personal humiliation and murder that have permeated the film belonged to neal all along .  but there too is a problem  as the explanations offered for his motivations are psychologically fuzzy to say the least .  the story owes us a better understanding of franciosas mind  his concealed madness and his sudden murderous rampage .  tenebrae is also marred by annoying little inconsistencies .  for instance  a teenage boy and girl leave a hotel room and minutes later we see the girl riding off on the back of a motorbike .  we would assume the rider is the same boy  but it turns out to be some male character we arent even introduced too !  thats careless filmmaking  pure and simple .  why  you may ask  do i go on about the storys flaws ?  because when it comes to visuals and set pieces  argento is one of the most exciting filmmakers in the world .  take one of the extended scenes in tenebrae .  an upset girl wandering the streets at night needlessly taunts a guard dog to the point where - almost unbelievably - it jumps a high fence and chases her across town .  finally  as she desperately seeks escape from this crazed canine  she accidentally stumbles on the serial killers lair .  its an absolutely masterful sequence  tense and exciting  and communicating a wealth of information through visuals alone .  and thats exactly the kind of thing that makes the flaws so frustrating .  too often  it seems  argentos films as a whole are less than the sum of their impressive parts .  mind you  if you love murder mysteries then tenebrae is still worth a look .  and if youre a fan of argentos unique style of giallo thriller then its essential .  see the uncut widescreen version if you can and drink in some of the wonderful cinematography by luciano tovoli .  its a stylish  great-looking and quirky film despite the problem narrative .  a shame  because it doesnt have to be that way .  take argentos more recent stendhal syndrome ( 1992 )  where with the aid of co-writer franco ferrini he fashioned a solid storyline without sacrificing any of his surreal weirdness or visual panache .  proof that he can do it  if he tries . . .  , POSas any sociologist will attest  your childhood and the types of parents that you have will heavily influence your happiness as an adult .  parents that are supportive and environments that are nurturing will yield children who will embrace the values and norms that can allow them to live healthy and productive lives .  but if your upbringing is marred with violence  hate and dysfunctionality  then your journey towards a happy adulthood will be saddled with psychological obstacles almost too great to overcome .  `affliction explores how a man never truly escapes the grip of an unforgivingly nightmarish childhood .  the man in question is wade whitehouse ( nick nolte ) .  here is a man who is like any other citizen on the surface .  he is a productive member of the community and goes about his daily routine much like you and me .  but as you scratch beneath the surface  something scary and evil begins to rear its ugly head .  we see that he is a mean-tempered person .  he has a hard time taking control of his emotions  which usually gets the better of him .  he is quick to apologize for his actions and wants to be a gentle person  but something is sparking a tendency towards violence .  he also has tremendous problems with relationships .  he is divorced and his only connection to love is his daughter .  but his bearish persona and stature alienates her .  he is visibly shaken by her rejection even though she says that she loves him .  his demeanor also puts his relationship with a local townsgirl ( sissy spacek ) at risk .  she tries to remain true to him and supportive  but for women unlucky enough to attach themselves to this kind of person  relationships will ultimately end like sentences ending with an exclamation point .  finally  he is spiteful and vindictive .  as a rejected father  he initiates a custody battle that seems hopeless .  as the towns only police officer  he issues a speeding ticket to a man whose father has just died .  we can see that this is a man that is both afflicted and living with pain .  he is a prisoner and a slave to it .  he is moving towards a level of madness and insanity that defies comprehension .  what kind of force can move a man to the edge of his emotions and beyond the reach of people who genuinely care for him ?  we learn that the answer is his father ( james coburn ) .  this is the kind of father that every son would be ashamed to have and that any woman would be afraid to meet .  he is an overbearingly misogynistic and frequent drunk who rules with an iron fist .  we see his tyrannical behavior through flashbacks .  to heighten the fathers churlishness  the flashbacks are shown as home video footage taken by a very frightened person .  very effective .  today  wades dad is quite elderly  but still manages to instill fear into a grown man .  the influence that the father possesses is inescapable  and its unsavory effect clamps down hard on the tortured wade .  the result is every sons nightmare ? becoming like the father that one has always dreaded to be .  this is a terrifically presented piece of psychological drama  and nolte turns in a strong performance as a man whose pain seems to become a detriment as well as a necessity .  hes a hulking person who is still reduced to whimpers when in the presence of his father .  coburn displays heft as the bitter dad .  but  its most certainly not saturday-night-friendly fare .  theres nothing light or fluffy about this film .  that may turn many moviegoers away .  but its certainly worth noting that this is a well-acted drama showcasing noltes and coburns raw acting talents .  , POSis evil dead ii a bad movie ?  its full of terrible acting  pointless violence  and plot holes yet it remains a cult classic nearly fifteen years after its release .  explaining why this movie stands out from others with similar plots ( including the original evil dead ) is extremely difficult .  `well whats it about ?   `five people stranded in a log cabin in the middle of nowhere struggling to survive vicious attacks from a variety of ugly  hairy  wart covered monsters .   `come on i saw a movie just like that on monster vision last week .  why should i see it again ?   `no evil dead ii is different  its funny .   `its funny to see people die ?  are you sick or something ?   maybe i am and maybe director sam raimi is as well to create such an enigma of a movie .  his unique execution is as sarcastic as subtle  as disturbing as it is hilarious .  an example of raimis odd approach : a monster ( formerly protagonist ashs girlfriend of all people ) is cut in half by a chainsaw and a tidal wave of blood comes from the open wound .  sure its over-the-top  but it is so over-the-top that it is laugh out loud funny ; just try watching ash with a straight face as he unexpectedly is showered with ten gallons of blood  staining his face and knocking him back a few feet .  the whole movie is like this  watch ash get beat up  watch ash defeat the monster  watch ash get beat up again by another even zanier monster .  the more repetitive and unrealistic the movie gets  the more amusing it becomes .  no matter how sick it may sound  it is funny to watch bruce ampbells ash get his butt kicked every five minutes .  and raimi takes advantage  he has ash tormented by the head of his girlfriend  by the body of an old lady  even by his own right hand .  like the less superior idle hands  we watch ash uncontrollably hit himself over and over again until he is forced to cut off his own body part .  but it doesnt end  ash now has to fight his severed hand which now moves with the same celerity as thing from the addams family .  all of these events  thrown at you from minute one with roller coaster- like camera movements  at first become shocking  then inexplicably funny .  raimi expects the audience to laugh and as the film progresses  he seems to be enjoying himself even more by borrowing the classic mirror scene from the marx brothers duck soup  then bringing more characters into the picture to comically kill them off .  with a running time of less than an hour and a half  raimi gets away with the impossible  making a horror film with more gore than plot and intentionally more laughs than scares .  ending evil dead ii with an opening for the third film in the series  raimi obviously had a lot of fun making this movie and couldnt wait to make its sequel .  , POSits rather strange too have two computer animated talking ant movies come out in a single year  but that is what disney and pixar animation ; s latest film represents .  while a bugs life isnt nearly as deep as its predecessor  dreamworks antz  it is just as funny .  a bugs life centers  appropriately  around the life of an ant  named flik .  flik  cutely voiced by newsradios david foley  hates sticking too tradition and attempts too find new ways of harvesting food and other task .  when one of his inventions causes the offering too be completely lost  the leaders of the colony send him out on a mission too get him out of the way .  the offering is food that a vile group of grasshoppers force the ants too harvest for them .  the leader of the grasshoppers is hopper  who is fiendishly voiced by oscar winner kevin spacey .  when the offering is lost hopper is very upset and he vows to return shortly too retrieve double the amount of food .  when the leaders of the ant colony send flik out on his mission  they never dream he will be successful  they just hope they can get him out of the way so they can harvest the extra food .  fliks mission is too hire some warrior bugs too fight off the grasshoppers when they return .  instead flik accidentally hires circus performing bugs  who he mistakenly assumes are warriors .  when he returns with the `warriors  the town is ecstatic until they find out the truth about their heroes .  a bugs life has animation that is simply stunning .  the sheer uniqueness of the day to day bug life is very imaginative .  together with the great voice acting  this film is the perfect holiday family film .  its main weakness is that it couldnt beat antz to the theaters  making it seem like stale material .  , POSnot since oliver stones natural born killers has there been a movie this incendiary  and not since david cronenberg has a so-called mainstream director been this willing to repeatedly tiptoe the fine line between pointed social commentary and outright social irresponsibility .  while finchers films have never suffered from a lack of shock value ( his major character killings in both alien 3 and seven are fine examples )  fight club marks the distillation of his pitch-black comedic sensibility ( see 1997s the game ) into something like a definitive statement .  jack ( norton  acting as both narrator and protagonist ) is your typical cubicle clone  whose disillusionment is amplified by a seemingly incurable insomnia .  on the offhand advice of a doctor  he sits in on group-therapy sessions for everything from blood parasites to testicular cancer .  here he meets bob ( marvin lee aday  aka meat loaf )  a cancer-emasculated eunuch with profound gynecomastia .  strangely  the release he finds while sobbing on bobs breasts allows him to sleep at night  at least until a fellow group-therapy  tourist  named marla singer ( carter ) comes along to ruin things for him  forcing a grudging compromise that recalls monty python in its dark hilarity .  later  he meets tyler durden ( pitt )  a soap salesman with a decidedly subversive outlook on life .  one night  after his ikea- furnished condo explodes ( dont ask-- youll just have to see the movie  awright ? )  he is goaded by tyler into a fight  and damned if it doesnt feel good .  it is pure  raw existence  a brief moment of clarity and purpose that makes his dreary workaday life pale in comparison .  he moves into tylers squalid abandoned mansion  and they form the titular organization  an underground therapy group where men bond with bare-knuckle savagery and very few rules  the first two of which are  dont talk about fight club .   armed with charisma and an attractive anti-corporate philosophy  tyler assumes leadership of the burgeoning membership of white-collar slaves and dead-end mcemployees .  resentment creeps into jacks heart  made worse by the fact that tyler is also regularly and noisily boffing the hated marla .  funded by a frivolous lawsuit  tyler begins molding his devotees into an army dedicated to mischief and mayhem .  their initially juvenile pranks ( like pissing in food and putting spike belts on roads ) quickly evolve into something more like sedition  and jack fears that things have gone sour .  it is after this point  when you are plenty uncomfortable and wondering just how far fincher will go to say something original  that the film uncorks a disappointing plot twist .  it is so contrived-- and so conventional compared to what precedes it-- that everything which follows ( including the ending ) becomes far less interesting .  its a major ( though not fatal ) flaw  and for a director as notoriously unpredictable as fincher  it feels like a cop-out .  fight club is going to be misconstrued by a great many people .  in the early going  it has a downright dangerous feel ; it seems to be saying that violence and civil disobedience are good for the soul  and this is undoubtedly the message that a few moronic punks are going to take from it .  ill be mightily surprised if imitation fight clubs dont spring up here and there  and ill be even more amazed if fincher isnt vilified for it by the same humorless witch-hunters that are currently after oliver stone .  they neednt bother  because fight club is less a message movie than finchers elaborate attempt at a joke .  tyler durden  for all his dionysian allure  is really nothing more than the logical ( and far less hypocritical ) extrapolation of all those self-help gurus who constantly show up on oprah to preach their me-first gospel of self-actualization .  in this context  the joke works  but like the latest columbine joke  some people will get it and enjoy a good laugh  and others wont .  hopefully  though  their silly moral outrage wont spoil the joke for the rest of us .  , POSplot : a bunch of bad guys dressed up as elvis impersonators rob a vegas casino during a presley convention .  the boys eventually get together to split the money  but as plans change  double-crosses occur  dealing and wheeling goes down and the crew set up for the road .  whos on the up and up  whos the real bad guy and whos gonna get to bang courteney cox are just a few of the questions which will be answered by the rest of this movie .  critique : the funnest movie that ive seen so far this year !  its got style  its got tough guys talkin shite and its got plenty of bullets to go around .  a definite hunk-a-hunk-a burnin adventure !  a guys guy movie through and through  and one thatll set your jollies to high if you dig on the rough stuff .  its not very original  it goes on for a little too long  but costner and russell make it happen  as two shite-kickin elvis lovers  who dont stop till they  more or less  drop .  this movies got some pretty intensive shoot-out scenes  one of the coolest robbery scenarios that ive ever witnessed  featuring several elvises with guns a blazin and the kings music playing in the background  and a decent helping of double-crosses  sharp dialogue and funny moments .  in fact  even though the cast is filled with many name actors ( b-actors as they might be for the most part )  most of them do their bit and succeed well in passing the torch onto the next victim .  but the true glue that holds this film together  other than the spirit of elvis himself  is costner and russell  who play their badass characters to the t . sure  russells been down this road before  but costner surprised me with his nastiness .  i guess hes pissed at all the box-office bombs that hes been in of late  but he sure played a great unstable elvis impersonating robber here .  in the end  the bottom line with this movie is having fun  kickin ass and making sure theres enough bubblegum around to chew afterwards .  and smoke em if you got em  folks !  there is also this one really great show-down scene between costner and a cop  thatll have you crackin up and lovin it all at the same time .  the violent scenes in this movie are violent and the entire film is wrapped in a soundtrack thatll kick your arse from this end of the theatre to the next .  it should actually come to no surprise to anyone that the director of this movie comes from a music video background  with plenty  and i mean plenty  of camera tricks  cuts and edits  but for this kind of flick  it actually works .  the film is not perfect though  it starts off with a pretty big bang  but then pulls a way of the gun on us  and slows the pace down somewhat in the middle  while characters intermingle and disperse .  i was personally kept in the game despite some soft spots  and enjoyed the overall ride for what it was as well .  and did i mention that courteney cox looked mega-hot in the movie ?  no . . . okay   well i just did !  i coulda done without her whole  romance  angle  but to be honest  it doesnt take up much of the film  which is generally covered in blood  explosions  guts and elvis nods .  try to see how many  inside  connections to the king you can guess .  of course  its no secret that i am quite a big elvis fan myself so please take this whole review with that grain of salt in mind .  i also like these types of  guy  movies a lot  and even though the film doesnt bring much originality to the table  it does offer a pretty coherent story  some nice twists and turns  humor and a big ol helping of whoop-ass coming straight from costner and russells respective boots .  probably not a film for everyone  but definitely for those who enjoy the guns  the charismatic bad guys and a fun  if entirely disposable  adventure .  now see how many elvis songs ive used to pun my way through this phony review below .  the elvis songs also recommend this movie !  so whether youre lonesome tonight or any other night  remember to pack the teddy bear with bullets  leave your little sister at home  bring your bossa nova baby and rock out of that jailhouse  cause this movie aint one to return to the sender .  i really beg of you  whether youre stuck in the ghetto or crying in the chapel  to slap this cinematic ring around your neck and love it tender .  and no suspicious minds either  folks  cause i got stung by this movie  i mean it really shook me up  and unless youre the devil in disguise himself  i think you wont be able to help falling in love with this lucky charm either .  so dont be cruel  dont turn away  dont curl up with your latest flame tonite ( whether she be a hard-headed woman or not ) and surrender to the hound dog of movies that is this film .  its now or never  folks .  trust me  i did it my way and the heartbreak hotel of crappy movies that id seen so far this year is far behind me .  joblo has now officially left the sanity of his mind and this building .  thank you . . . thank  you very much ! !  wheres joblo coming from ?  get carter ( 7/10 ) - heat ( 8/10 ) - honeymoon in vegas ( 9/10 ) - payback ( 8/10 ) - reindeer games ( 5/10 ) -reservoir dogs ( 9/10 ) - way of the gun ( 6/10 )  , POS>from the commercials  this looks like a mild-mannered neil simonesque tale with mary tyler moore baring her bra touted as the highlight .  instead it turns out to be a hilarious film running in high gear from beginning to end .  the concept is deceptively pedestrian .  an adult adopted son is looking for his biological parents and encounters eccentric characters along the way .  the movie demonstrates just how far a good script and actors can take a mundane idea .  the son and his wife take off on the search accompanied by a woman from the agency who located his parents .  following one dead end lead after another  each funnier than the previous  they eventually end up in new mexico with his real biological parents : alan alda and lily tomlin .  its difficult to condense the mile-a-minute plot .  seemingly hundreds of scenes jump on top of each other without giving you a chance to recover from the last one .  without giving too much away  one of the better episodes involves a gay federal alcohol  tobacco and firearms agent attempting an arrest while tripping on lsd as his bi-sexual partner is upstairs licking the armpit of a woman while her husband is in the next room seducing their traveling companion .  and its all done in a fairly clean  almost ( well  maybe not exactly ) family fare manner .  a grand cast ( tomlin  alda  moore  ben stiller  patricia arquette  tea leoni  george segal ) interacts in a seamless parade of laughs .  drawing from a more hyper woody allen style  the film succeeds beyond expectations .  , POSim not quite sure how best to go about writing this review .  i must admit that i was a little disappointed by barry levinsons political satire  wag the dog   but in retrospect  this has less to do with the film itself than with false expectations i had going into it .  quite a few of the reviews i have read led me to believe that this film was absolutely hilarious and would make me laugh out loud the whole way through  and it didnt do that .  they also led me to believe that it would deliver a vicious and all-too-true attack on the way the american political media works  and it didnt quite do that either .  a few of them even suggested that it would prove a worthy successor to stanley kubricks  dr .  strangelove  in the tradition of political black comedy  and it most definitely didnt do that .  that said   wag the dog  is actually a very clever satire on the shady manipulations of political figures and those who assist them .  the story revolves around the attempts of political spin doctor conread brean ( robert deniro ) to distract the american public from the accusations that the president  who is up for re-election in two weeks  sexually harassed a young girl in the oval office .  the accusations  the script suggests  are probably untrue  but as brean so pointedly puts it  that isnt particularly relevant : the scandal is likely to derail the presidents campaign regardless of its truth or falsehood .  brean  along with his assistant ( anne heche )  decide to contact hollywood producer stanley motss ( dustin hoffman ) to enlist his help in concocting enough propaganda and special-effects trickery to make it appear that the u . s . is going to war with albanian terrorists and thus propel the president to victory on a wave of patriotic fervor .  as i said   wag the dog  is not quite as laugh-out-loud hilarious as i had expected  but there are some genuinely funny moments to be found here  such as when  in an echo of a familiar movie clich ?  the camera pans out over an urban sunset to the strains of uplifting  inspirational music  then cuts to a studio to reveal that the singing is coming from a group of musicians whom motss has assembled to perform  we have the right to fight for democracy .   another scene shows us how  with modern editing equipment  an actress running across a sound stage with a bag of potato chips can be turned into a frightened young girl and her kitten fleeing a terrorist attack on her village .  the most consistently effective gag revolves around the propaganda teams attempt to forge a fictional war hero out of sgt .  william  old shoe  schumann ( woody harrelson )  an ex-military officer who turns out to be a first-class psycho .  of course  not everything goes as planned ; the cia  for example  realizes whats going on and strikes a deal with the presidents electoral opponent to report to the media that the  fighting  has ended  forcing motss and brean to come up with a new angle on the supposed albanian crisis .  still  even with the cias involvement  the film falls a little short in terms of making this scenario believable .  regardless of the official word from the president or the cia  wouldnt the major media outlets have eastern european correspondents who could verify that there is  in fact  no fighting going on in albania ?  the film never addresses this question  nor does it show the reactions of the american public to the news of the apparent war except for a few scenes which border on the farcical  such as when basketball fans litter the court with shoes in support of the aforementioned sgt .  schumann ; we are apparently meant to assume that everyone is buying it .  there was also an instance  towards the end of the film  in which one of motsss forced reinventions of the story seems to contradict what he and brean had been selling to the public thus far and could conceivably have given the game away .  with these plot holes   wag the dog  doesnt quite work as a satire of american politics  but it does send up the mentality that might lead to these kinds of machinations in the first place .  brean and his advisors never seem concerned that what they are doing is unethical ; rather  they worry about how convincing it will be and whether or not they have enough money to pull it off .  the film takes a decidely dark turn towards the end  as we learn how far they are willing to go in order to keep the propaganda campaign a secret .  motss and his hollywood buddies  meanwhile  seem completely out of touch with the rest of the world and just see this undertaking as another creative project .  in fact  one of the sources of conflict in the film is motsss increasing restlessness with the idea of not being able to take credit for producing the fake war ; in his mind  it is the greatest work of art he has ever created .  i think its fair to say that  wag the dog  underachieves a little bit : more attention to the public reaction and tighter plotting might have made this into a four-star film and a classic satire .  still  the issue of an american president using war and patriotism to distract from scandals or domestic unpopularity is a very real one .  wag the dog takes the issue one step further and asks  what if the war wasnt even real ?  with this premise and the talented cast  the film still delivers more consistently than most  whatever its flaws .  , POSthe sheer horrific audacity of the nazi plan to exterminate the jews of europe is almost incomprehensible .  people may make documentaries about it for another hundred years and still not understand the organized  methodical hatred .  five concentration camp survivors from the last days of world war ii tell their stories in the last days  the first documentary from steven spielbergs survivors of the shoah visual history foundation .  the five interviewees are linked by their hungarian ancestry .  as the introduction explains  even as germany started to lose the war  the nazis stepped up their extermination of the jews in europe .  in 1944  hungary had the last big population of jews within germanys reach  and they became the last target of hitlers  final solution .   each of the five tells his or her story .  their stories are intercut chronologically  starting from normal life in pre-war hungary .  they recall the nazi invasion of hungary  being sent to  work  camps and their realization that they were actually in death camps .  they recall their horrible  precarious lives in auschwitz and buchenwald ; the deaths of their family and friends ; their loss of hope .  each recalls his or her unfathomable  eventual liberation .  and finally  the last days shows their cathartic  pained  modern-day return to their old homes and the camps .  needless to say  their stories are horrifying  amazing  and emotionally draining .  by themselves  the stories would be forceful testaments  but by cutting them in parallel  their impact is multiplied by five .  the last days is a talking-heads style documentary -- its mostly pictures of people telling their stories  intercut with period photographs and newsreel footage .  in this kind of movie its almost impossible to get archival pictures from the same time and place being discussed on-screen  but director james moll made a better effort than most at finding specific  or at least relevant  images to go with his subjects narration .  the liner notes ( one of the many nice features of this dvd ) indicate that there is some never-before-seen historical footage in the last days .  its not clear which scene it is .  it could be one of two that i hadnt seen before  both powerful .  one is rare color footage  shot by an american  of piles of victims in cattle cars .  there is something jarring  something unsettling about seeing the pictures in color  when so much of the footage from world war ii is in black and white .  another segment shows walking skeletons ; survivors who are so starved that they hardly look human anymore .  there has been a glut of holocaust movies and i was skeptical that a new documentary would have anything new to say .  but by focusing on hungarian jews during the last days of the war  moll told a specific part of the story in a new way  in greater detail .  and im glad he did because his careful filmmaking stands up well compared to other movies on the same subject .  the transfer to dvd is rich and beautiful .  x-mozilla-status : 0009f words for a holocaust documentary  but some of the interviews take place in europe in late spring  when skies are blue and trees are green .  also  the movie was shot on 35mm film ( and not video ! )   so the richness and detail are impeccable .  the dvds features are plentiful and well-chosen .  there is a theatrical trailer for the movie  which is a great introduction to the subject matter .  there are about fifty still photos  both from the production crew and from the private collections of the survivors .  also  the disc has two complete versions of the movie ( widescreen and full screen )  both on the same side .  one of the more interesting dvd features is an outtake segment for each of the survivors ( plus one for the crew ) .  youd think outtakes would be inappropriate in a holocaust documentary  but theyre not bloopers .  instead  they are solid  moving segments that were probably cut from the film only for length .  one of them continues a confrontation that was only touched on lightly in the film .  renee firestone ( one of the five ) spoke on camera with dr . hans m ? nch  a german doctor who ran the medical clinic at auschwitz .  firestone was aggressive  questioning the doctor about what his children thought .  the doctor was evasive and clearly uncomfortable .  another of the outtakes showed bill basch saying a prayer for his dead friends at auschwitz .  he ends his prayer by saying  . . . forgive me for surviving .   its ambitious to shoot a documentary on 35mm film .  its ambitious to make it on a subject that has saturated cable  television  and movies .  its ambitious to make it 54 years after the events it covers .  but the last days handles all these potential obstacles very well .  its only fitting that the dvd  with its wealth of interesting and relevant features  would also be ambitious and successful .  , POSit is easy to label something sentimental or tear jerking when one has not experienced the heartache of losing a child ? whether that may be in life or in death .  after having said that  i will also say that this movie does all of the above very well .  one gets that choking sensation in the throat ( because of grief ) when one brother forgives another for a costly mistake  or when a husband hugs his wife after a long estrangement .  there is no ocean  no drownings and it does not conjure up memories of yet another ? ordinary people .  in fact the only thing remotely connected to the ocean is probably tap water and the toilet flushing ( not that this literally happened in the movie ) .  so what are the lessons learnt : 1 .  dont take your children to class reunions .  2 . dont leave them alone in the lobby  not even for a second .  michelle pfeiffer once again plays the role of a highly-strung wife and mother  a trend that started with ? a thousand acres and ? one fine day .  my comment is that she is exceptionally fine strung in this movie  so much so that when she has a nervous break down  the veins on her temples bulge impressively .  whoopi golberg also puts in an understated performance  playing a lesbian cop  with a name that makes one want to reach for a lollipop .  lastly  who are the ideal companions for this sort of movie ? my grandmother comes to mind .  , POSi know that  funnest  isnt a word .    fun  is a noun  and therefore cannot be conjugated like an adjective .  but thats the word that came to me right after viewing  chicken run .   no wonder : this is the kind of movie that reduces you to childish expressions  like  that was the funnest movie ive ever seen !   so to hell with websters --  chicken run  is one of the funnest movies ive seen in a while .  i cant remember the last time ive seen anything funner .  the chickens at tweedys farm are up to something .  living in a concentration camp-like atmosphere  they are led by one plucky hen called ginger ( voice of julia sawalha ) who continually comes up with plans for escape -- and always gets caught  subsequently spending day after day in the coal box .  one night  a brash american rooster flies in over the fence  calling himself rocky ( mel gibson )  famous flying rooster and circus performer .  rocky promises to teach the chickens how to fly  and the situation grows more desperate as the nefarious mrs . tweedy ( miranda richardson ) decides to abandon the farms egg-selling plan for a pie-selling plan .  she orders a huge pie-making machine  cackling   chickens go in ; pies come out .   what sort of pies ?  chicken pies  of course .  co-director nick park and his studio  aardman animation  produced three oscar-winning short films :  creature comforts    the wrong trousers   and  a close shave .   the latter two were the second and third installments of a trilogy starring the delightful team wallace & gromit  a man and his dog famous for getting themselves into increasingly peculiar adventures .  part of what made the  wallace  films brilliantly entertaining was parks uncanny ability to make an old story seem new .    the wrong trousers   for example  pulled out a lot of old hitchcockian suspense tricks  and  a close shave  owed a great deal of inspiration to classic detective stories .  but in the hands of park and his team  the stories felt fresh and inspired  and not the least bit contrived .  now teaming with co-director peter lord  park has created a similar creature in  chicken run .   the plot is largely lifted from  the great escape  ( watch for a quick reference to the ball-bouncing scene )  with some spielberg-inspired action sequences providing the excitement .  thing is  the film doesnt feel like its been lifted from somewhere else ;  chicken run  feels fresh  alive  like nothing else ever done .  part of it is the original idea : who in the world came up with the idea to make a prisoners-of-war movie starring chickens ?  park and lord milk the incongruity for all its worth : the characters treat their situation as if it were dead serious  and to them  it is .  but theyre * chickens *  so its funny to us .  another thing that helps  chicken run  ( and most of parks films ) succeed is the animators subtle way of giving nods to the very films theyre cribbing .  there are references to  the great escape   obviously  and  stalag 17 .   the chase sequence inside the chicken grinder parodies both  raiders of the lost ark  and  indiana jones and the temple of doom .   theres even a nod to  the blues brothers   if you can believe it  and the filmmakers even get in a little light-hearted ribbing at the expense of their star voice actor  taking a couple of very subtle jabs at mel gibsons nationality and film history .  the  braveheart  reference is a hoot if you catch it .  when you consider just how fine a line resides between a funny parody and a redundant one   chicken run  is downright brilliant in its execution .  consider this : since july of last year  ive seen dozens upon dozens of  blair witch project  parodies  on television  on the radio  and online .  out of all those  maybe one or two were amusing  the rest tiresome .  why ?  because once you got past the thought that  theyre parodying that&#8216 ; blair witch movie   most of the parodies had nothing to offer -- no insight  no original idea  no greater purpose .  they were only funny if you had seen the movie ; otherwise  you got nothing .  conversely   chicken run  doesnt lean on its parodies -- the film references are never the sole focus of any scene .  if youve never seen  indiana jones   the chase sequence is still fun .  even if you have no idea who mel gibson is  rocky remains an interesting character .  park  lord  and screenwriter karey kirkpatrick realize that an audience does not need a parody shoved in their faces before its understood  and as a result   chicken run  is filled with visual and verbal jabs that are never too obvious  but not quite vague either .  enjoyment of this movie doesnt require knowledge of film history  but if youve got it   chicken run  is that much richer .  the voice cast turns in uniformly lively performances  and the characters they play are given so many subtle nuances that its hard not to fall in love with every one of them .  ginger is perfect  spunky and opinionated  but with a soft heart that forbids her to leave her companions behind  and julia sawalha ( known as the cute mousy girl on  absolutely fabulous  ) nails it .  she has warm  human chemistry with gibson  whose rocky hides his personal doubt under a brash gung-ho veneer .  the characters inevitable romance doesnt feel contrived  but sweet .  poor mr . tweedy ( tony haygarth ) suspects the chickens are organizing in some way  but his limited intellect prevents him from figuring things out  and his overbearing wife certainly isnt any help .  jane horrocks delivers a lovely voice characterization as tragically optimistic babs ( a hen that runs away with most of the best one-liners  all while perpetually crocheting a sweater )  and two supply-trading rats that seem to have walked straight out of a monty python sketch nearly steal the show during the lively central swing-dancing sequence .  they even come up with an inspired riff on something thats baffled scholars and theologians alike for decades : the chicken vs . egg dilemma .  one might have expected this inevitable joke to come off as wearisome  but as with most of  chicken run   it comes as a delightful surprise .  the film manages to cross all barriers ; it should be accessible to both children and adults  brits and yanks  rats and chickens .  the animation is first-rate .  remember that this was all done the old-fashioned way  with actual humans moving clay figurines around on a tiny set bit by painstaking bit  and you see just how truly remarkable  chicken run  really is .  this movie possesses that same quality that makes pixar studios animation great : precise and unwavering attention to detail .  as in such top-notch family fare as  a bugs life  or  toy story 2    chicken run  has something to offer in nearly every frame .  certainly a passive viewer can enjoy it as a straightforward story with a worthwhile moral and some surprisingly touching scenes  but a active  attentive viewers will enjoy it even more because theyll catch all the details .  anyway  the movies just a boatload of fun .  funnest damn movie ive seen all year .  , POScapsule : a short punchy action sequel to the two dinosaur films made by steven spielberg .  joe johnston directs a straightforward story of an excursion back to the island of the dinosaurs .  it lets us see some new dinosaurs ( is that an oxymoron ? ) and gives us a nice and generally reasonably written adventure .  the film is neither ambitious nor pretentious .  i had a good time .    low +2 ( -4 to +4 )  here goes my credibility .  this is a film on which i expect to be in a minority .  i liked the third jurassic park film .  i even liked the second jurassic park film .  in a lot of ways jurassic park : the lost world was a creative three-way braiding together of michael crichtons novel the lost world  arthur conan doyles novel the lost world  and the classic silent film version of the doyle .  jp2 was an adventure  as doyle said   for the boy whos half man or the man whos half boy .   that is what all the jurassic park films are .  expecting them to give the viewer insights into the human condition is like expecting your car to vacuum your house .  the classic adventure films like gunga din or king solomons mines had under-written characters also .  jurassic park iii is an all out adventure on an island inhabited by dinosaurs .  the characters are a little more complex than they at first appear to be  and even that is a little more complex than i was expecting .  some of the characters who start out looking stupid and useless prove to be neither as the film proceeds .  that degree of complexity combined with those very realistic looking dinosaur effects is just about as much as i require .  i feel i got my moneys worth .  the story opens with eric ( played by trevor morgan ) and friend parasailing near the forbidden island of isla sorna off costa rica .  this was the research island where the dinosaurs were created for the now defunct jurassic park .  they hope  no doubt  to get a look at the islands dinosaurs from a safe height .  the height is safe  but driving the boat in the water is not .  the two soon find themselves in trouble and have to ditch their parasail onto the island where they do indeed get a better look at the dinosaurs than they had intended .  flash to the united states and someone is offering to fund paleontologist alan grant ( sam neill ) in his research if he will go and fly over isla sorna and act as a guide .  he has said that no force on earth or heaven could get him back near real dinosaurs .  but again money convinces him to drop what he is doing and go .  doing the convincing is a wealthy and eccentric couple ( william h . macy and tea leoni ) who has been just about everywhere else in the world and wants the adventure of seeing real dinosaurs .  they too plan to see the island from a safe height grant is relieved to learn .  he will fly over this island at a safe altitude just this once .  right .  guess what happens next ?  jp3 probably functions better as a sequel than jp2 .  first it has alan grant and ellie sattler ( laura dern ) back rather than the much less appealing ian malcolm .  sattler has a much smaller part in jp3  but is still present to tie this story to the first .  curiously each film seems to arrange to have a signature scene with characters holding on to some large metal object that is about to fall some great distance .  one thing that does not quite fit with the earlier films is just as grant discovers that raptors may be able to talk to each other  suddenly they seem to be doing it all the time .  they did not appear to be conversing in the previous films .  of course  these raptors look a little different also  so perhaps they are a different related species .  not only are they more intelligent than in the past films  they are also more sympathetic .  in this story they are not just killing machines  they have reasonable motives for what they do beyond nutrition .  this time around they may be a little too anthropomorphized .  each new film in the series introduces us to some new dinosaurs  of course .  in this film a major threat is from a spinosaurus  not as common or as popularly known as a tyrannosaurus  but larger and presumably more nasty .  it has a crocodiles head and the body that looks like a dimetrodon walking upright .  perhaps as an economy measure or just to create a mood the visual effects team frequently obscures our view of the dinosaurs .  sometimes they just move too fast to see .  occasionally darkness or fog obscures our vision .  a few times we get unconvincing matte shot  particularly of the laboratory .  but there is less money on the screen in terms of dinosaur effects than in the two previous films .  the musical score by don davis borrows heavily from john williamss score for the first film .  joe johnston  who directs  already has to his credit two very good films i recommend the rocketeer and october sky .  a team including alexander payne and jim taylor known for election writes the screenplay .  the film they have made is a long way from great cinema  but it still is fun .  if you get a thrill from seeing what look very much like live dinosaurs alive today  the film is for you .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  , POSjust look back two years ago at the coen brothers comedic gem the big lebowski  change the actors  take away the bowling alley  add a record store  and youve got high fidelity ( or maybe the other way around since nick hornbys novel high fidelity came first ) .  either way  its been done before  a trio of losers cracking jokes and complaining about their failed romances  yet it remains consistently funny .  why is this ?  maybe because you know your life is much better than this  you know these guys are more pathetic than you are  and you know its ok to laugh at them because theyre fictional .  director stephen frears  possibly not intentionally  has created a movie that makes you feel good about yourself and even that ostensibly no good uncle who watches television twenty four hours a day .  when watching high fidelity  expect to laugh at someone elses pain  realize what you are laughing at  and then laugh again .  i laughed at dick ( todd louiso )  the shy  timorous  steve buscemi character of lebowski  who seems to know what he is talking about but either cant put it into words or is harshly rejected by his friends .  i laughed at the john goodman character barry ( jack black )  an exact replica of the comic bookstore owner on the simpsons  pudgy  egotistic  and obnoxious at the same time .  and i laughed at rob ( john cusack )  the jeff bridges type  whom the story revolves around .  rob is the character easiest to relate to  but he is nothing like you at all .  he uncontrollably cheats and lies  then is unable to realize why he can not hold onto a woman .  and like his other miserable friends  pop music is where he inevitably goes for comfort .  he spends the afternoons at his job quizzing his coworkers with obscure trivia or listening to new music and either deriding it or praising it .  whatever human emotions the clash  aretha franklin  and bruce springsteen records hold  rob and co .  grasp them and help fill voids in their social lives .  rob has built an extensive collection in his record store as well as his home and he organizes them depending on what mood he is in .  during this confused stage of his life in which the movie focuses on  rob is trying to cope with numerous rejections over the years by visiting past girlfriends and eventually asking why they dumped him .  but these arent any girlfriends ? these girls made the all time top five break ups in the history of rob ( robs incessant use of lists show how pop music has played a major role in his life ) .  the plot in three words is : women and music .  the approach director stephen frears takes by having the charismatic rob speak directly to the camera is very effective .  it gives high fidelity a quickly paced  informal structure  adjectives which perfectly parallel robs own lifestyle .  it also helps open the viewers eyes as to how annoying barry is .  jack black steals the show with a hilariously realistic performance as a total sleaze ball .  just listening to him speak for five minutes makes the audience immediately sympathetic for rob  who must work with him every day of the week .  what frears does so well is that he makes us feel sorry for rob while laughing at his misfortunes .  john cusack plays his character convincingly but it is the strong supporting cast  consisting of big stars and character actors  that really defines rob .  now instead of rob just talking to the camera  after he explains something  the remaining cast members physically and humorously create what he is trying to say .  the only problem with high fidelity is that it doesnt end when it should have ended .  instead the movie goes on for a torturous twenty minutes that seem a lot longer than that .  also bruce springsteen is completely wasted in a brief cameo halfway through the movie .  high fidelity is a cheerful  old fashioned comedy with a voluminous soundtrack and as many laughs .  i just hope hollywood keeps creating losers on the big screen  they make everyone look and feel great .  , POSplot : a human space astronaut accidentally falls upon a planet ruled by apes .  he is taken prisoner along with some other humans  and tries his best to escape his simian captors .  oh yeah  and did i mention that the apes can talk ?  kewl !  critique : despite this film not looking like a  tim burton movie  or its lead human character showing any signs of being a human being himself  i did find myself generally entertained throughout most of this film and do recommend it as fun  summer fare .  although the thing that sets this movie apart from all others is definitely its incredible ape make-up jobs and characterizations .  i mean  i was completely convinced that every single one of these apes was for real !  i also have to  give it up  to all of the actors inside the costumes  not only for waking up at three in the morning every day to get make-up slobbered all over them for 2-4 hours  but for coming through their costumed exteriors and selling us their characters on the screen as well .  i especially enjoyed bonham carters performance  who i believed to be the most developed character in the entire film ( human or ape ) and tim roths bad guy  who chewed up scenery and oozed evil in every scene in which he took part .  plot-wise  i liked the beginning of the film  the whole build-up once wahlberg got into the village  the escape and most of the fight scenes  but once things got out into the deserted area ( and the final battle sequence )  i kinda lost a bit of my interest .  i was much more intrigued by the interactions between the characters and the whole idea of  human beings as animals  then i was about the end battle sequence  which just seemed a bit too typical for this kind of film .  i also hated the  kid  character who just got on my nerves and didnt really care for the way that the battle sequence was resolved ( i wont ruin it here but cmon guys . . . you  coulda thought of something a little more plausible than that  no ? ) .  but the thing that held this movie back more than anything else was its lead character  his cold demeanor and the zero chemistry that he shared with either one of his inter-species love interests .  this dude didnt seem to give a rats ass about anyone but himself and i ultimately didnt really care about what happened to him either .  now im not sure if this was the fault of the actor or the script  but the film suffered because of it .  visually  the movie was also nice to look at ( especially the apes ! )  but i definitely expected greater coolness from tim burton .  the  surprise ending  that highlighted the original planet of the apes film back in 1968  felt a little tacked on here  and despite being interesting  didnt really make all that much sense to me ( unless you look at it from a sequel point of view ) .  so overall  i loved the whole  feel  of the planet  the apes that ruled it  the manner in which they treated the humans  screamed  shouted and reverted the entire evolution chain  but didnt appreciate the films lack of human character development ( why was kris kristofferson even in this movie ? ) and the fact that its lead male and female humans were just plain boring .  but i would still recommend this film as a fun  summer movie with laughs  creepiness and a really cool premise .  ps : for anyone who has seen the original  i cannot believe that they didnt at least bring back the scene in which the lead human character ( in this case  mark wahlberg ) goes nuts at the world in which hes suddenly been thrust (  this is a mad house !  -  type of thing ) .  the guy in this film barely seems to be  put off  by the fact that hes surrounded by apes who can speak english ! !  wheres joblo coming from ?  the arrival ( 8/10 ) - battlefield earth ( 7/10 ) - godzilla ( 4/10 ) - instinct ( 6/10 ) - mission to mars ( 3/10 ) - pitch black ( 7/10 ) - ( 1968 ) planet of the apes ( 9/10 ) - sleepy hollow ( 8/10 )  , POSdisaster films have a tendency to be very formulated and very cliched .  to see a disaster film with actual originality  or at least a decent plot twist  would definitely be a welcome surprise .  unfortunately  folks  its not likely .  dantes peak is cliched  and at times corny  but also pretty decent .  to be honest  i wasnt very interested in seeing this film  and word of mouth  as well as several reviews  didnt make it sound promising .  so i was pleasantly surprised that to find that this movie wasnt bad at all .  its pretty run of the mill  but its not something i would say is merely  ok  to watch .  in case you dont know  dantes peak is about a volcano and the city which lives in its shadow  dantes peak ( who wouldve guessed  eh ? ) .  pierce brosnan plays the volcanologist sent to study the volcano and  perhaps more by hunch than actual scientific proof  is determined that the volcano will be arupting in the very near future .  due to the lack of more substantial evidence  nobody warns the small town  and when they finally do  its in the middle of the town meeting that the volcano finally blows .  brosnan  all around good guy  will  of course  save the day .   .   .  or at least the mayor of dantes peak ( linda hamilton ) .  naturally the two will become infatuated with one another .   ( if you think i just ruined a plot development  you havent seen very many movies ! )  theres also the virtually neccessary kids and pet dog to tug at your heart strings .  and of course  the kids or the dog ( at least one or the other ) will do something heroic .   .   .  but hey  i dont want to ruin all the surprises !  if there was a part of you that was hesitating seeing dantes peak merely because it was rumored to be a waste of time  i urge you to watch it and decide for yourself .  its not brain food  but it succeeds at what its meant to be .   .   .  an enjoyable  suspenseful movie about the fury mother nature can unleash !  , POSin brief : best bleak comedy film since heathers .  full of wonderful swipes at the fifteen minutes of fame mentality that feeds so much of modern american pop culture .  go see it !  so  i prepared for this film by watching a moving interview on  hard copy  with pam smart  the new hampshire media teacher who was convicted of engineering the death of her husband back in the 1980s .    hard copy  s diane diamond asked smart what she thought about nicole kidmans fictionalized portrayal of her in the new film to die for .  smart replied that she thought kidmans character came off as a dumb  vicious tramp and she thought that the publicity the new movie generates might just hurt her chances in her latest court appeal .   ( smart was convicted and given a life sentence for her part in the murder of her husband . )  smarts got a point .  it wouldnt be the first time that the public took the better scripted and well-acted movie version of an event as the absolute truth over the duller and far less artistic real life version .  however  given a choice between the mass media happening of the real event and the fictionalized movie  i would definitely opt for the later .  real murderers rarely have dialogue as witty as what buck henry has written for this movie and smart  while pretty and alluring  is no match for the cinematic charms of nicole kidman .  to die for begins in a town called little hope  new hampshire  the archetypal dry and intellectually barren american suburb .  the story concerns the ambitious suzanne stone and how she tackles the obstacles between her and her life long ambition of being on tv .   of course  one of those little obstacles turns out to be her dull and unambitious husband larry  played by matt dillon .  but  with a little imagination  some charm and raw sex appeal and a rather novel approach to junior achievement  our heroine manages to overcome the nay-sayers in her life  at least temporarily .  kidman triumphs in the trashy role of suzanne .  i have never really been all that fond of this actress but she shows a wonderful flair for comedy in this picture .  her portrayal of the incredibly shallow and dumb femme fatale resonates .  kidman knows a star-making role when she sees it and she plays the conscience-deprived suzanne as the ultimate career driven  post-feminist uber-temptress from hell .  she is ably abetted by wonderfully demented comic dialogue  which kidman delivers in a unselfconsciously funny way .  at one point suzanne is expounding on her knowledge of world events to her future husband and sister-in-law .    you know   she knowingly exclaims   gorbachev would still be the leader of russia or whatever  if he had just had that ugly purplish thing removed from his head .   her husband beams at suzannes profound knowledge of world politics and then proudly proclaims that this qualifies her to be the next barbara walters .  this is very close to pop culture bashing heaven  folks .  the other standout performance in the film is delivered by joaquin phoenix .  he plays jimmy  a burned out teenager who becomes addicted to suzannes sexual favors .  kidmans character  vapid though she is  is a sort of suave beacon of success to jimmy and his lost friends russell and lydia  winningly portrayed by casey affleck and alison folland .  phoenix looks like the very embodiment of gen-x slackerhood ( as envisioned by tabloid tv  of course ) .  his jimmy has the dead eyes and demeanor of a kid who knows that he aint going anywhere  ever .  phoenix reacts to the sexy suzanne with a sort of obsessed amazement and he makes us believe that a loser character like jimmy really would be willing to kill for someone like suzanne  someone who actually noticed him .  gus van sant ( drugstore cowboy  my own private idaho ) direction is first-rate .  he keeps the pacing in this not-quite-thriller snapping along .  van sant rightly keeps the focus of this movie on the amoral suzanne and doesnt stop to proselytize the audience about the rightness or wrongness of her actions .  van sant trusts his material and trusts his audience to get it without stopping to explain what is funny about this all-american story .  the screenplay  by buck henry  is absolutely great and includes some of the best bleakly comic lines ive heard since heathers .  henrys story is a blast against the shallowness of the american media and the mindlessness of fame  yet the screenplay delivers this sharp message by focusing on just a few characters .  henry ably manages to avoid diluting his story by aiming at too many targets and the result is a crisp and funny mini-classic .  danny elfman did the original music for this movie and he delivers another eccentric  loopy score that strongly echoes his themes for edward scissorhands .  either film score would make wonderful background music for halloween trick-or-treat parties .  all-in-all  a wonderful production  well worth your seven bucks !  to die for : a columbia pictures release directed by gus van sant .  written by buck henry score by danny elfman starring nicole kidman  matt dillon  joachin phoenix based on the book by joyce maynard .  rated r - for language and mature themes .   ( respect the r  not for under 14s ) rating ----- stars .  go see it .  , POSi relish those rare opportunities when a talented screenwriter can make me feel like a fool .  i spent the first hour of forces of nature slowly stewing over its grim attitude towards marriage  grousing to myself about its transparently planes  trains and automobiles plot machinations  and waiting for the inevitable hollywood denouement .  this was a mass market romantic comedy  after all  a genre which has been taken over by teenagers and  even in its best days  worked hard to perpetuate the romance = infatuation paradigm .  then marc lawrence did something wonderful  something which made the entire film click into place : he showed me a comic love story about grown-ups .  it certainly didnt look that way from the outset  which introduces groom-to-be ben holmes ( ben affleck ) at his bachelor party  surrounded by friends and family whooping over his  last night of freedom .   ben loves his fiancee bridget ( maura tierney )  but the doom-and-gloom pronouncements of everyone around him have him questioning the meaning of this till death do you part business .  then  on an ill-fated flight from new york to his wedding in savannah  ben meets sarah lewis ( sandra bullock )  a free-spirited woman with a string of failed careers and relationships behind her .  as transportation troubles thwart them at every turn  ben and sarah begin a three-day southward journey in which their connection grows ever stronger  ben seeing in sarah the chances hes never taken and sarah seeing in ben the stability shes never had .  forces of nature gets off to a solid enough start  setting up the characters and the situations with plenty of witty dialogue .  ben is an ideal role for afflecks easy-going charm  and he plays the straight-laced straight man without forced exasperation .  sandra bullock  for her part  is more loose and appealing than she has been in her last half-dozen films combined  avoiding her recent habit of playing any semblance of character depth as moping .  the two performances -- part of a great top-to-bottom cast -- are effective and connected from the start  yet the scripts apparent sympathy with the marital horror stories ben hears makes it difficult to enjoy the romance completely .  lively and funny though it may be on a consistent basis  forces of nature leaves a bitter taste that feels like self-justification .  the kicker is that those acidic anecdotes serve exactly the opposite purpose  leading to a surprisingly emotional resolution .  forces of nature isnt about a man developing a fear of commitment ; its about a man learning what commitment means _to him_  learning that its not what he thought it was .  lawrences script feints and dodges before reaching its happy ending  an ending which is happy because people make the choices that make the most sense .  earlier scenes that might have felt like throwaways take on more resonance  and that bitter taste sweetens into something fresh and genuine .  though one too many plot contrivances keep ben and sarah together through the film  and they do exchange the obligatory mutual character analysis of bickering screen couples  forces of nature wraps up so perfectly that youll end up remembering the humor and the simple wisdom .  that is  provided youre not put off by the ridiculously busy direction of bronwen hughes .  for a brisk romantic comedy  forces of nature comes loaded with some of the most over-directed scenes of the year : teetering hand-held shots  why-not low or high angles  sweeping pans .  occasionally the hyper-real approach works  with cinematographer elliot davis creating a world of fantasy romance ; far more often  hughes refuses to let a scene be what it is  covering it with flourishes so thick you almost cant find whats underneath .  a script this smart and mature deserved a more restrained director  but even hughes excesses cant spoil this unique concoction .  forces of nature may restore your faith in romantic comedy as something with the power to enchant  something that can make you happy to be proved wrong when you expect a tale for and about adolescents .  , POSwarning : this review contains some spoilers for the 1964 film  fail-safe .   if you havent seen the film yet  proceed with caution .  nutshell : a relevant  intelligent  suspenseful drama .  still powerful today  even after the end of the cold war .  --------------------  fail-safe  ( usa  1964 ) drama  111 minutes  screenplay by walter bernstein based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler produced by max e . youngstein directed by sidney lumet  review by jamahl epsicokhan --------------------  the most ironic aspect of nuclear war is that it doesnt have a winning side and a losing side .  in a nuclear confrontation  everybody loses  and the aftereffects have devastating effects that impact the entire world--assuming the world survives .  the idea--and perhaps the only real option--is to avoid war at all costs .  this is the theme of sidney lumets  fail-safe   a fictional drama based on the novel by eugene burdick and harvey wheeler .    fail-safe  takes place during the heart of the cold war ( the actual film was released two years after the cuban missile crisis )  when the united states and the soviet union were in static discord over an issue that can be summarized in a single word : communism .  the premise centers around a combination of accidents and operation flaws .  five u . s . bombers carrying nuclear warheads are ordered to set a routine course for moscow after an unidentified aircraft is spotted heading toward america .  the unidentified aircraft turns out to be a commercial airliner  but a mechanical failure strikes the military base that commands the bombers .  suddenly out of contact  and with standing orders to remain on course until receiving new directives  the bomber pilots cannot be recalled  and they proceed to moscow with the intention of destroying it with a nuclear strike .  a great deal of  fail-safe  s plot follows various characters as they attempt to devise ways of stopping the u . s . bombers from reaching russias borders--at any cost .  the plot is compelling  and the story creates urgency and dread by painting the grimmest of worst case scenarios .  the reality sets in quickly as one attempt to turn the bombers after another fails .  general bogan ( frank overton )  taking orders directly from the president of the united states himself ( henry fonda )  is powerless--the fate of the world lies in the hands of an automated  pre-programmed system that may not be stoppable  simply because the creators of the war machines were too efficient in their task to make a no-win situation winnable .  the events in  fail-safe  are fascinating because theyre anything but predictable  but the real reason  fail-safe  works is because it understands more about nuclear war than what exists within the confines of its plot .  a key ingredient to the film is its ability to create an ongoing polemic about nuclear war  communism  the cold war  and the united states role in all of it .  most of this is through the films use of the character groeteschele ( walter matthau )  an arrogant civilian theorist of nuclear weapons use who  incidentally  is on the presidents advising staff for analyzing the statistical plausibility of waging a nuclear war .  many of the films most pointed messages arise from discussions where groeteschele is one of the key voices .  early in the film  he hosts a dinner party where he explains the importance of  strategy  in a nuclear assault to  minimize  casualties .    whats the difference between 60 million and 100 million dead ?   a guest asks impatiently .    forty million   groeteschele responds wryly .  the problem with groetescheles mindset is that he * believes * nuclear combat to be a viable method of war .  the only difference to him between nuclear armageddon and conventional warfare is the raw data and the casualty totals .  groeteschele realizes that these weapons can destroy the world several times over .  yet his answer to the arms race is not to slow down and try to cool the situation off  as general black ( dan oherlihy ) has often recommended .  on the contrary--according to groeteschele  that would lead to russia having * more * nuclear weapons than the u . s .  which would clearly put america at a disadvantage .  such a stance was perhaps the central paradox and misguided practice of the arms race .    fail-safe  clearly sees it as one of the central issues of the cold war  and  likewise  it becomes a central theme in the film .  why continue to build such machines of mass destruction while already possessing enough of them to destroy the world several times over ?  is it wise ?  is it even logical ?  no  not really .  although  fail-safe  is more about the issue of nuclear weapons than it is about the political ramifications of communism  there is a scene in the film that deals with communism in an intentionally superficial  one-sided sort of way .  again  this is achieved through groeteschele  who is easily the films most important character in terms of the larger-theme significance .  in addition to providing the central  pro-nuclear war  voice that the film warns against  he also makes key remarks about communists that show just how much fear and resentment people of the period were prone to when it came to communism .  the context the film uses suggests that this hatred was often glib .  one of groetescheles  logical  trains of thought ventures so far into fantasy theoretical prediction that its merely absurd .  he labels the average marxist an  unfeeling  calculating machine  that will do whatever it takes to preserve itself .  groeteschele takes it so far as to say that if the u . s . drops the warhead on moscow  the soviets will * instantly * surrender  for to retaliate would invite counter-measures that would further destroy russias home soil--which must be preserved at all costs .  groeteschele seems to forget these people are human beings with emotions ; general black quickly reminds him that the soviets would attack out of revenge--as any normal person would .  the irony here is groetescheles own mechanical theorizing .  he is so quick to judge the enemy that he doesnt even realize his own seemingly programmed thought patterns .  once the film makes it evident that turning the u . s . bombers will be impossible  the question becomes what the * consequences * of destroying moscow will be .  just how will the soviet unions leader react  and what can the president do to convey his best intentions ?   ( just * how * does one pass off the deaths of millions of people as an * mishap * ? )  with the help of his translator buck ( larry hagman )  the president negotiates at length with the soviet leader  in scenes that prove amazingly taut and powerful in their simplicity  with lumets long takes of fonda and hagman in the same frame  exchanging the dialog between the president and the soviet leader .  without getting into too much detail  i will say that the compromise they ultimately reach is very costly  yet necessary and as sensible as possible under the circumstances .   ( that is  as sensible as a nuclear  incident  can probably be . )  it does accomplish what it must : it avoids an all-out war  something that simply isnt possible because of its all-too-real consequences .  dramatically  the ending is quite powerful  and the use of oherlihys character as the symbolic  matador  ( providing a bookend to the film by ending the story while tying into his dream sequence from the films opening )  is particularly appropriate .    fail-safe  is a production of a major hollywood studio ( released by columbia pictures )  and it has the structure of a high-tension suspense thriller that one might expect from a hollywood film .  nevertheless  under lumets direction and walter bernsteins intelligent adaptation of burdicks and wheelers novel  the film continues to have a lasting effect even after the events on screen have unfolded .  the film often warns that the automation of war is something that may make nuclear holocaust an unintentional consequence of such mass arming .  but it was the conscious  human choice to * initialize * this automatic arming that  fail-safe  also finds dangerous .  in retrospect  the arms race seems to be one of the most puzzling exercises in futility of the century .  its just fortunate that both sides were finally able to come to their senses and slow down  rather than continuing groetescheles dangerous approach of speeding up and causing a possible meltdown .  , POSandrew lloyd webbers musicals  preferably his early work with lyricist tim rice  present a musical which is totally unlike any musical before its time .  webber and rice do not subscribe to the gaity of such musicals as  oklahoma !   or the slapstickness of shows like  a funny thing happened on the way to the forum .   they instead tackle hot issues from our past  and view them differently  and pack them together with redundant  catchy music  as well as thoughtful lyrics .  like  jesus christ superstar   which examined the rise and fall of jesus in his last days from a fame perspective ( in the cool tune  superstar   a dead judas comes back from the dead to ask jesus why he didnt spread his message wider )   evita  takes an inventive stance on its topic  this time being the famed wife of argentinian dictator  juan per ? n  eva  who slept her way to the top and became famous chiefly because she got attention  much like the woman playing her : madonna ( although i think madonna did rise to the top for her musical talent  among other things ) .    evita  deals with the rise and fall of eva per ? n  a woman who captured the heart of the nation after marrying juan ( jonathan pryce )  then died at the young age of 33  creating an international stir of mourning not unlike that of princess di ( the two do share a bit in common  although it wasnt like di slept to  the top  ) .  webber and rice sure chose bizarre topics for their musicals  but they always have a point for doing it .  here  they wish to expose her for what she is  but still show that despite all of her many drawbacks  her lying  and covering up for her fascist husband  but show that she was still a good woman with fairly good intentions  and her death was very sad .  its also a musical  with almost no words not unsung .  the film plays like a rock opera  much like their  jesus christ superstar   with many giant musical sequences just like the old musicals  even if they do possess very intelligent lyrics  which create not only an intellectually enlightening experience  but also a very entertaining one .  after all  this is a musical  and webbers musicals never undermine this .  they are a balance of energy and intellectual depth  walking on a fine line between the both  and never stumbling on either side .  this is why the beginning of  evita  is kind of a let-down .  okay  it is a let-down .  im not saying the opening moments are bad  because theyre pretty good .  but what comes after is a lifeless  un-entertaining  and totally unrewarding sequence where she cons a singer ( jimmy nail ) into taking eva to buenos aires after a one-night stand .  in the musical  its a fun  energetic sequence  culiminating in the show stopper   buenos aires   which is also lifeless .  then a punch is pulled as we see eva being screwed over by the singer  instead of her leaving him  where she ends up singing the sad tune   another suitcase in another hall   which was meant for a later character  screwed over by eva .  the portrayal of eva in the beginning is too soft  seeming like parker and oliver stone  who adapted it for the screen  are afraid to present her for what she is  even while its being narrated by a hater of evas  the omnipotent ( antonio banderas )  who presents her in a negative light .  for a while  it looks like alan parker cant pull it off .  however  the film pulls itself together in a flash  and after that song is over  and the giddily nihilistic song  goodbye and thank you   where we see eva go through a long line of lovers who help her ascend  is magnificent  darkly comical  and just gleeful .  from this point on  the film is hypnotic  satisfying  and satirical .  no more punches are thrown  and the basic outline of the original musical are in tact .  we see eva woo and marry juan  get him out of jail  rise to stardom  falter a bit  come back  and then gradually die of cancer ( i think it was because of cancer ) .  more importantly  many of the themes from the musical carry on with this  as well as some filling-in-the-gaps reconnassaince work .  juan  who is pretty underwritten in the musical  is given some extra scenes  and exposed as what he was for eva : an accessory .  a muted scene where he tries to visit her respective room but is shunned allows us to learn more about juan  and understand his sadness more than we did before .  >from the  goodbye and thank you  number on  the film shows eva trying to cover up for the horrible government by doing cheap and petty things which wooed a nation  and saved a government  even while it left the nations people downtrodden .  but despite this  the nation still loved eva  and when she slipped into death  the world mourned her because she was a star .  thats when our narrator  ch ?  comes out to show that she wasnt the great woman she really was  and expose her fame .  describing this character is difficult  mainly because he has no real realistic background ( hes said to be based on the revolutionary ch ? guevera  but the two probably could have never met  like they do in the film )  but he serves as a perspective on eva  but even his perspective cant help us from feeling bad when eva dies a pathetic death .  alan parker  no stranger to bizarre musicals ( hes done  fame    the committments    bugsy malone   and  pink floyd the wall  - the latter which is absolutely brilliant )  nails the film  exposing everything for what it is .  we cry for evita at the end because we feel we should  by the way it is presented .  his direction is manipulative for a reason : to show the mourning for what it is .  and there is energy throughout  with lots of bright colors  and scenes which are cinematically entertaning  as well as enriching and deep  such as the balcony scene where she sings  dont cry for me  argentina   and her death sequence  which is poignant becuase of how sad it is .  madonnas golden globe winning performance is much like the movie : starts kinda downhill then goes up quickly  remaning there for the rest of the film .  at the beginning  she looks like shes too busy concentrating on her singing to act  but she eventually gets it right  though never really getting the presence of  say  patti lupone ( who did the role in its american premiere back in the late 70s ) .  her death  though  is brilliant .  her singing could be better though .  i know she took lessons to improve her range and all  but it still sounds like shes trying to hard .  she sounds way too soft in several places where she should be comanding ( like . . . patti  lupone - i heard her sing on an old  evita  cd  and you could just feel her stage presence without even seeing her ) .  but its generally very good  although not up to the brilliance the role really requires .  antonio banderas  who is almost like a guilty pleasure these days ( im one of the few people who thinks he rocks )  is extremely comanding in his performance  presenting a lovable narrator .  his singing is very good  though nothing compared to the original  mandy patinkin .  he does have a pretty good singing voice  and a great range .  and jonathan pryce is pretty awesome  although very brief at times  in his role as juan  seeming to put on a poker face for his melancholy facade .  although it gets off to a rocky start (  rocky  s polite for what it really is )  it soon picks up and becomes a wonderully poignant musical .  like the other musical released in 96 ( woody allens  everyone says i love you  )  its a reminder that the hollywood musical may be dead  but it can come back every now and then for a brief performance .  , POStheres more to a quilt than fabric and thread--each patchwork design has its own unique story ( or stories ) to tell .  in how to make an american quilt  the first hollywood release from australian director jocelyn moorhouse ( proof )  we come to understand how the tales of the seven makers imbue their creation with passion and vitality .  all the sorrows  joys  longings  sufferings  and loves of these women are sewn into their quilt and  as their bittersweet memories are given expression  one young woman applies these lessons of the past to her own uncertain future .  motion pictures are filled with male bonding rituals ; how to make an american quilt presents a distinctly feminine alternative .  the  quilting bee  consists of seven members : sisters gladys ( ann bancroft ) and hy ( ellen burstyn ) ; sophia ( lois smith )  a woman known for frightening children ; emma ( jean simmons )  the timid wife of a perpetually unfaithful man ; constance ( kate nelligan )  who has been having an affair with emmas husband ; anna ( maya angelou )  the leader of the group ; and marianna ( alfre woodard )  annas daughter .  the project theyre busy with is the wedding quilt for hys granddaughter  finn ( winona ryder )  who has just become engaged .  shes spending the summer with hy and gladys  and away from her fiance  to decide whether a lifelong commitment is really what she wants  and whether its better to marry a friend or a lover .  one of the greatest pleasures of how to make an american quilt comes from watching an array of fine performances by an impressive ensemble cast .  from winona ryder  ann bancroft  ellen burstyn  and maya angelou to minor players like rip torn  claire danes  and kate capshaw  this film is overflowing with realized talent .  the performances are good enough  in fact  to cover up many of the scripts weaknesses .  how to make an american quilt is basically an unremarkable  if affecting  tale of love across the generations--a sort of truncated american version of the joy luck club  with a dash of fried green tomatoes added .  there are probably too many characters .  so  instead of really getting to know a few of them  we are presented with quick glimpses into a single defining event in each of their lives .  we learn about the root of the smoldering resentment between gladys and hy  and are told the reasons why emma stays with her husband and sophia is so irascible .  there are other episodes as well : the love of annas life  mariannas soul mate  and a look at the reasons why constance entered into an affair with her friends husband .  the sum total of these tales is meant to provide the framework for finns story : whether to go forward with her marriage or dally with a hunky stranger .  there is no emotional epiphany in how to make an american quilt .  the stories are all well-told  but its difficult to really connect with the characters--their moments pass so quickly .  while we certainly feel something for each of the eight principals  our emotional investment is tenuous .  there isnt enough depth to pull the viewer in all the way  and many of the personalities and relationships feel half- formed  like a quilt with patches missing .  to put it bluntly  while i enjoyed watching this film  it didnt  do much  for me .  on the whole  how to make an american quilt is a nicely-understated drama that has a lot to say about love  passion  and monogamy in relationships .  finns segment is by far the most compelling  because shes the focal point : her actions are shaped by everyone elses experiences .  the other patches of this american quilt are successful only to varying degrees .  if theres a disappointment here  its that the script doesnt have more resonance  but the privilege of seeing such a fine cast in top form allows a viewer to enjoy this picture even if the story is somewhat conventional .  , POSmimi leder is probably best known for her stunning work as a director of the hit tv-show er .  her mast famous episode   loves labour lost   dealt with the ordeal of doctor mark greene as he tried his best to save the life of a pregnant mother and her child .  the way she moved the camera and created tension throughout every scene was amazing .  there was more excitement and adrenaline rushed suspense than just about any of hollywoods big blockbuster movies .  so its only natural that leder would get to direct her very own hollywood blockbuster .  and i have to say  after a shaky beginning  she does not disappoint .  peacemaker deals with the theft of nuclear weapons by terrorists  which is obviously nothing new .  the first half hour goes into detail  way too much detail  about how the weapons are stolen .  despite a few good images  including a train collision and a very impressive explosion  none of this was very coherent .  its long and drawn out  and i would have settled with a more implausible beginning that would have moved the story along better .  once george clooney and nicole kidman enter the picture  it begins to take off .  george clooney is an air force colonel with connections all over the world .  he has a nice sarcastic wit and the rough edges that you expect from most clooney characters .  nicole kidman is head of a white house team on weapons smuggling .  there is the usual flirtatious banter between the two  but that is dispensed with quickly .  the story takes clooney and kidman across the globe  trying to figure out who has the weapons and where they are going with them . clooney  goes through bouts of sarcasm  frustration  determination  and revenge while kidman works against her own insecurity and self-doubt .  this is when leder starts to show her true stuff .  she starts us off with a nifty little car chase as an appetizer .  then we get clooney doing heroics in and out of a helicopter .  then that leads us to the brilliant final showdown on new york citys crowded streets  and a madman with a nuke walking among them .  mimi leder is a natural at creating suspense .  she reminds me of wolfgang petersen in her ability to make the most routine action sequences exciting and breathtaking .  nicole kidman is an intelligent female action hero .  youre not gonna find her falling down so clooney can come back to save her .  george clooney is a real movie star .  many of you may have hated him as batman  but this guy is for real .  he has a natural screen presence  and an ingratiating personality .  hell be around for a while .  dreamworks is off to a satisfying start with peacemaker .  , POSi have to say it .  tim burtons retelling of planet of the apes is more fun than a barrel of monkeys .  ok  thats off my chest .  no more monkey puns  i promise .  seriously  though  planet of the apes is one rip-roarin summer outing  filled with thrills  action  adventure  wit and bits of funny ( dare i say  monkey ) business .  i know  i know  i promised .  and for those film buffs who are fond of the original  burtons version includes a couple tips of the hat to that movie .  mark wahlberg stars as capt . leo davidson  a deep-space pilot whose ship gets drawn into a magnetic field and hurled into the future .  he crash lands on a planet where apes are the dominant species and humans are hunted  captured and sold into slavery .  despite being darker than the original  burtons film is not as heavy handed nor as sanctimonious .  some of the movies flashes of humor are surreal as well as typically burton : an organ-grinder ape with a midget or an elderly ape taking off a wig and removing false teeth as he prepares for bed .  then there are the parents who buy a little girl as a pet for there young daughter .  the seller advises the parents to get rid of the girl before she reaches puberty :  one thing you dont want in your house is a human teen-ager   he says .  you dont have to be an ape to realize the truth in that statement .  touches such as these are what stamps this movie with burtons brand .  lines that hearken back to the original movie are sprinkled throughout : the first words spoken by an ape to davidson as the astronaut is regaining consciousness and grabs the simians foot to try righting himself are :  take your stinking hand off of me  you damned  dirty human .   anyone familiar with the first version of the film will  of course  recognize the irony in that piece of dialogue .  another of burtons in-jokes is to have charlton heston  star of the original  play the chimpanzee father of tim roths gen . thade .  the young chimp goes to visit his dying father .  both have one thing in common  a hatred of humans .  with his dying breath  the elder spews out his vile :  damn them  damn them all to hell   he says before expiring .  that is the famous line hestons taylor shouted at the conclusion of the original after discovering the planets terrible secret .  the performances throughout are top-notch .  wahlberg plays davidson not as some gung-ho hero  but as a confused and somewhat frightened explorer who only wants to return home .  he is reluctant to lead the human rebellion ; his only objective being to find a way off this upside-down planet .  this hesitation is what makes his character believable and vulnerable .  roth is ferocious  cunning  cruel and savage as the fascist chimp who wants to rid his planet of all vestiges of humanity .  he leaps and bounds as if he had springs on his feet .  it is a masterful turn .  helena bonham carter is ari  the chimp who believes that apes and humans can live in peace and as equals .  hers is a smart  compassionate characterization .  michael clarke duncan is big and brutal as attar the gorilla aid to thade who blindly follows his leader until his faith is shaken .  a fine comic outing is given by paul giamatti as limbo  the ape slave trader making a living off the misery of the humans he captures .  as the battle between apes and humans looms  the cowardly limbo pleads   cant we all just get along   echoing the words of rodney king .  much of the success of planet of the apes goes to burtons technical crew  especially production designer rick heinrichs and the legendary rick baker who created the ape makeup .  burtons musical collaborator  danny elfman  provides another fine score  though it is not as memorable as his work on batman or sleepy hollow .  the movies only letdown comes at the very end where burton tries to outshock the finale from the 1968 original .  he comes close  but falls short .  otherwise  planet of the apes is what a summer movie should be : an amusement park ride filled with lots of action  stunts and a few laughs .  this is one feature in which the expectations lived up to the pre-release hype .  , POSurban legend surprised me .  based on the last few films the genre has produced ( including but not exclusive to the likes of i know what you did last summer  disturbing behavior and the disappointing halloween : h20 )  i was positive that i was in store for another mildly entertaining but silly and ultimately boring rehash of the scream phenomena .  thankfully  legend rose above its soggy premise to become not only a hip  scary and stylish entertainment  but also what will probably become one of the best films of the year .  youre all familiar with the plot ; a bunch of overly horny teenagers get systematically slaughtered by a masked maniac whos identity is not revealed until the closing moments of the film when it turns out to be  you guessed it ; everybodys favorite veteran of the whodunit flicks . . . the  only person you didnt suspect !  however  just because legend doesnt really break any new ground as far as literary or even technical achievements go does not mean that it cant qualify as first-class entertainment .  it was  believe it or not  one of the funnest times ive had at the movies all year .  the thing is  im not really sure what made this particular stab ( pardon the pun ) at the genre seem so fresh and alive .  maybe it was the above-par performances by the movies two leads ( jared leto and  cybil  actress alicia witt ) .  or  it could have been the on- target direction by jamie blanks .  more likely  though  it was because of the inspired premise .  i dont think i need to tell you that a killer hacking people up ala urban folklore is much more frightening than a killer fisherman .  urban legend begins with a sequence that reminded me of the classic scream opener  not so much in plotting as in attention to detail that makes for an absolutely chilling teaser for the rest of the film .  a pretty young coed is driving down a deserted road when ( gasp ! ) a gas problem ( hee-hee ) forces her to stop at an equally deserted gas station for a refill .  one problem  though .  would you want to stop at a station run by brad dourif ?  i thought not .  predictably  the attendant ends up coaxing her into the main building to sort out a problem with the credit card company .  its odd  though  when you pick up a phone to realize that nobodys on the other line .  naturally  the potential victim escapes into her car and drives off .  and the when we least expect it . . . whack ! ! !  a decapitation .  it turns out that the creepy looking attendant was just trying to warn her about the maniac in the back seat of the car .  so who is it this time ?  the obvious candidate is the slightly off-kilter professor at the college the girl went to ( none other than freddy kruger himself  robert englund )  who teaches a class on urban legends .  a-ha .  or could it be the fame-hungry local journalist ( leto ) looking for a meaty story to put on his resume ?  like all movies of this nature  one of the chief pleasures is trying to guess whodunit .  and it turns out to be  of course  the one you didnt suspect .  im not going to pretend urban legend is anything more than it is  but i must give credit where credit is due .  and this flick definitely deserves credit for being what not many other recent horror films have been . . . fun .   * complimentary movie ticket courtesy of valley cinemas in lodi  ca  , POScapsule : the verma family is having a wedding and all the relatives will come for the multi-day festivities .  mira nairs film is pleasant enough with a little human drama  a few family secrets  some sadness and some happiness .  you have seen it all before  but perhaps not from india .  the photography is colorful and the music is very agreeable .    low +2 ( -4 to +4 )  mira nair previously directed salaam bombay and mississippi masala .  her newest film  written by sabrina dhawan  is very similar to previous films like betsys wedding but it is set in new delhi .  a wealthy family is having a wedding .  an indian wedding is a multi-day affair as much a family reunion as a nuptial .  even more than in the us  it is an excuse for a lavish and extravagant family get-together .  the film shows us what the family does together and at the same time follows several family members individual story lines .  aditi verma is marrying hemant  an indian engineer working in the us .  she had previously had a relationship with vikram  her supervisor .  latit  her father ( played by naseeruddin shah )  is juggling many problems  not the least of which is worrying about the caterer has hired pk dubey .  dubey is a rather eccentric man with a taste for eating the marigolds he uses for decoration .  even dubey will soon be romantically entangled when he becomes interested in alice  one of the family servants .  several family members arrive giving rise to several plotlines involving sex  family secrets  or both .  there are heartbreaks and there are people falling in love .  some of the subjects covered are probably near taboo for indian films .  western audiences will appreciate a look at unfamiliar indian customs like women painting their hands with henna .  on the other hand it was not clear ( to me at least ) if scenes like the family singing together are typical of indian culture or if they are a convention of indian musical films .  this seems a particularly westernized family with the father wearing american designer sweaters and the family speaking mostly english .  the latter will  however  help with an international release .  sabrina dhawans screenplay is vibrant with witty dialog .  we have seen films with plotting very much like this  but the indian setting makes a great deal of difference .  director mira nair calls the film an affirmation of life .  i rate it a 7 on the 0 to 10 scale and a low +2 on the -4 to +4 scale .  , POSthe love for family is one of the strongest driving forces in any mans life  especially for those who have fostered their family under precarious circumstances .  thematically in cinema  love for family has been used frequently and emphatically to highlight more abstract aspects of characters ; it is rare  however  for it to develop as outstandingly as it does in roberto benignis neo-classic drama  life is beautiful .  through a central cast of father  mother  and son  benigni demonstrates the wonderful  undying love that a family shares in the best of times and the worst of times .  life * is * beautiful for guido orefice ( roberto benigni  directing himself here for the sixth time in his career )  an italian jew  master con man  and aspiring waiter extraordinaire .  living in 1930s italy  he lives a carefree life of good fortune ; it is made even better when he happens upon a pretty schoolteacher named dora ( nicoletta braschi ) .  although dora is already engaged  guido manages to sweep her off her feet and persuades her to marry him instead ; the two have a child named joshua ( giorgio cantarini ) .  unfortunately for the happy family  the third reich and its nazi minions occupy italy and imprison all jews in work camps .  it is after the movie takes this dramatic turn that the movies theme of family love becomes the strongest .  although prior to this turning point benigni plays guido with a sort of goofy charm  he relaxes the role to ensure his sons happiness .  now  instead of awkwardly seducing the sweet dora  he constantly reassures his son that everything will be all right .  benignis performance is truly a well-rounded one  and certainly one of the more fluid turns all year .  the supports are all strong as well  but the movie truly excels in its script .  life is beautiful is a self-proclaimed fable  one which tells its story in grand  two-part fashion .  in certain parts it manages to sink to the level of a  saturday night live  spinoff -- a number of humorous skits connected by a token plot -- but in the movies second half the scripts circular nature becomes admirably obvious .  characters make reprise appearances in fine form  and certain events which are intially curious become critically linked to the plots outcome .  in all  fans of foreign film will see this as a memorable motion picture  and novice movie-watchers may take this opportunity to see their first  artsy  film .  life is beautiful is an artsy movie by convention but easily accessible to everyone  and above all is a fine thematic picture .  , POSwhile watching wes andersons rushmore  it may be surprising to think that the role of max fischer  the films anti-hero  was not written with jason schwartzman in mind .  the young actor  making his film debut as a 15 year old student at the exclusive rushmore academy is so perfect in the role that it comes as a shock that anderson auditioned some two thousand other prospective stars before discovering schwarztman .  schwartzman plays max  a student who is more interested in his extra-curricular activities ( such as writing edgy plays like  serpico  and being president of the rushmore beekeepers ) but sees his grades suffer as a result .  on the brink of being thrown out  he lands himself in even more hot water when he falls for first grade teacher rosemary cross ( olivia williams ) and enlists the help of millionaire acquaintance herman blume ( the great bill murray ) to build an aquarium ( on rushmores baseball field ) in her honour .  unfortunately for everyone involved  blume finds that he has feelings for miss cross as well  which gets in the way of maxs plans to woo her .  max is one of the best-written characters weve yet seen in the 90s  and schwartzman plays him to perfection in one of the finest comedy performances ever given by someone of his age .  as everyone else has probably already pointed out  he is reminiscent of a young dustin hoffman ( although i was reminded more of paul from  the wonder years   from a visual standpoint  at least ) .  hopefully  if he avoids typecasting as weird  quirky loner-types he should earn himself a good career .  bill murray is his equal as blume  displaying a depth we havent yet seen from him .  while this isnt his best performance ( that honour goes to groundhog day ) he is still terrific here .  williams isnt given much to do except react to schwartzman and murray  but still does fine work .  rushmore seems to go just a little too long but  while it isnt a perfect film  it is a definate must-see for anyone who wants to see that rarity  an american coming-of-age film that actually works well without an excessive amount of sentimentality .  anderson has created a modern classic with a star who should  with any luck  rise to even greater success .  , POSno  i did not read the novel by thomas hardy   jude the obscure   his final novel ( final because this film created such an outrage that he never wrote again - see : i did do some research on it ) about a man who is plagued with bad luck throughout his entire life .  but  after watching the movie  i can imagine how incredibly depressing it is .    jude  is a satirical film from start to finish about societys way of spitting out and chewing up those unwanted in its system  but whats remarkable is how timeless this film is .  the film takes place in the late 19th century ( or early 20th - wasnt really sure )  but its story could even be retold today in modern form  although itd be kinda different ( a given ) .  it tells the story of jude ( christopher eccleston - the psychotic accountant from  shallow grave  ) - a simple  dim-witted young man with big dreams .  in its bleak  foreboding opening  shot in grainy black and white  he gets a lesson from phillotson ( liam cunningham )  his teacher : as they stand upon a mountain  looking upon a city in the distance  he says all you have to do is work hard and you can have anything in the world .  after marrying and divorcing an immature woman named arabella ( rachel griffiths ) because they frolicked in the hay ( literally ) but did not ultimately share anything in common  he moves away to a town with a giant university  with a chance to learn more  and get ahead in life .  taking a welding job  he works hard while studying constantly for his college bars  reciting latin over and over again  and training himself .  but when he sends his application for the school in  he is bluntly told to just remain a worker .  another reason for going to this town was because someone in his family lives there : sue ( kate winslet )  his cousin and a very intelligent but kinda mischevious young woman who wants to be a school teacher .  she and jude click eventually and become very endearing friends  so much that when she spends the night at his flat after running from her apprentice teacher job ( for none other than phillotson at the local school )  there are rumors that she and jude did some nasty business ( nudge nudge ) .  several twists turn in the storyline  and eventually jude and sue do do some nasty business ( an interesting scene  to say the least . . . )  and are soon born into a controversial non-wedlock  as she eventually gives birth to their baby  and jude inherits his son from arabella  who turns up again after awhile .  because they arent married  and because theyre cousins  they run into problems with every place they go to  carrying around two children everywhere  and only staying in lodges for a very brief period of time  then moving on .  if you didnt think this was harsh enough  wait till you see what happens later on . . .  the sad truth is that jude is one of the miserable people who can never get any luck in this world .  he will never gain any true happiness  and any happiness that happens to him will be fleeting  and will probably bring more horrible instances to his life .  part of it is his fault - hes too optimistic  and too gullible .  but society has a way of taking these people  and hurting them until their death .  the ending of  jude  is bleak because it has to be ( although i hear the ending of the novel is even worse - guess ill have to read it now ) .    jude  offers a satirical view on societys cruelties  but shows no way of curing this  and thank heavens it doesnt .  theres no way to relinquish the selfishness of society  and any solution would be too small to cure such a mass problem .  satire has always been one of the few ways of changing certain peoples minds  and thats what  jude  is .  sure  its one hell of a downer  but it needs to be .  the film also posesses two fantastic performances from its two leads  and some good supporting work along with it .  christopher eccleston ( slightly resembling richard edson with his new look and dumb expression ) plays jude wonderfully  sometimes bringing a big dumb smile to his face  and making him kind of child-like at other times .  kate winslet  in a pre-  titanic  performance  is brilliant  nailing every psyche of her character  and creating someone whos troubled but very seductive with her personality .  kate may be the best actress in her age group ( if you dont believe me  see  titanic   branaghs  hamlet    sense and sensibility   and  heavenly creatures   the latter one being my favorite performance of hers ) .  in the supporting roles  liam cunningham is a wonderfully flawed teacher  exposing all his bad parts  but ultimately being a pretty good person ; and rachel griffiths is wonderfully immature as judes wife  whom he never divorces .    jude  moves at a very slow pace  and keeps taunting its viewers with chances of happiness for its protagonists  which would drive some people nuts .  but those who appreciate good social commentary with their films  no matter how slow or downright depressing they are ( this one is both ) will appreciate  jude   though i doubt anyone truly enjoys it .  , POSquaid stars as a man who has taken up the proffesion of dragonslayer after he feels he is betrayed by a dragon early in the movie .  he runs into the last dragon in existence  and there is a genuinely amusing battle between the two which results in a standoff where quaid is in the dragons mouth  but has his sword pointed at the dragons brain .  eventually  they decide to call a truce  and they work out a deal .  since he is the last dragon  he will pretend to die and quaid will be able to get paid for it .  their scam works at first  until they come to a town without any money .  instead the town sacrifices a girl to the dragon  but of course  draco is a nice droagon  so he wont eat her . there is however a very amusing scene where draco is hitting on the young girl .  of course  as you can probably tell by the plot  this is a silly movie  but it does know when to take itself seriously at the right times  unlike eddie  which was serious all the time .  you could probably call this a medieval comedy  because there are more laughs here than in eddie and spy hard combined .  dennis quaid makes a fine hero .  pete posthlewaite provides some ghreat comedy as a monk who journeys with them .  dina meyer is appealing as the sacrificed girl .  but lets face it  the movie is really about the dragon  and what an amazing creation he is .  connerys voice and ilm team up to provide us with a truly magnificent dragon .  so  if you are going to see this movie for a strong hard core medieval epic  you are going to the wrong movie .  if you are going because of the dragon  you will not be dissapointed  and you will be provided with plenty of laughs that smooth out the boring parts in the script .  , POSit has been 20 years since a terrence malick film hit theaters .  his new film  the thin red line  is a strange  beautiful  enigmatic mess of a movie .  the first thing that jumps out to one when they see the advertisements for this film is the huge cast .  it is filled with above-the-title stars .  the cast  for the most part  gives great performances .  john travolta  whose role is nothing more than a cameo  seems not to have attacked his performance with that much verve .  george clooney  whose role became a cameo in editing  gives a strange performance .  one wonders if he knew that his performance would become the object of ridicule through a characters narration .  the rest of the cast  especially nick nolte and elias koteas  are unambiguously fantastic .  these actors ( and they are  with two exceptions  men ) were lured by the name of malick .  terrence malick is a cinematic legend .  he has often been called  the j . d . salinger of cinema .   his two previous films  badlands and days of heaven  are spectacularly beautiful and obscure motion pictures .  after he made them  he disappeared for 20 years .  this film marks his return .  what hes made with the thin red line is a film that seems less concerned with plot than with the emotion of the moment .  the narration which fills the film ( and perplexes many ) not only lets us hear the narrators ( the characters themselves ) pontificate  but also lets us hear such of-the-moment thoughts as  im scared .   the rather simple plot of the thin red line is used as a canvas on which many stories are painted .  the plot couldly simply be boiled down to an assault on a hill .  a plot synopsis for the thin red line is difficult  because the story is fractured .  many stories are here  from the clash between the lieutenant ( elias koteas ) and the savage colonel ( a voracious nick nolte ) to the private ( ben chaplin ) who uses his love for the woman he left behind to keep him going .  the fracturing of the story is ultimately a fault .  it is as if an artist spent an incredible amount of time artfully sculpting tiny statues and then threw them into a box  shook the box  and poured the results onto a table .  this basically creates a mess  but the stories can be discerned and enjoyed .  im not declaring that the film has no structure .  while saving private ryan used warfare to bookend the plot  malick uses reflection and glorious shots of nature to bookend about 90 minutes of combat .  the battles in the thin red line are astonishing and display a mastery of filmmaking .  the astounding cinematography in this film must also be given notice .  this film uses color and light in such a fantastic way  that it will be sad to see it degraded when it has to bee transferred to video .  ultimately  malick has crafted a film that is a movie that enjoys looking through the treetops more than regarding the war that rages below them .  the film is filled with nature photography and the regarding of nature .  while some have said that the anti-war message and pro-nature tubthumping was juvenile  it was done with so much complexity and thought  that it cannot ever honestly be called childish .  after seeing the thin red line  i was haunted by it and am quite ready to see it again .  , POS  stuart little  is one of the best family films to come out this year .  its a cute  funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords .  though i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about  i do know that this film does not disappoint .  finally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be  with a few surprising twists  some very funny moments  and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie .  stuart little is a mouse .  he has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption  he now lives with the littles .  a nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city .  they have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son .  at first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat .  george doesnt take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first  but once the two play together they instantly bond .  stuart however is missing something  and he wants to know who his real parents are .  the littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back .  hesitating the littles know whats best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat  he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuarts past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending .  one thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects .  just like in  star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace  stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real .  from the detail of their fur  to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows .  another movie that this has in common with is  babe  with its talking animals and people understanding them .  it has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids .  michael j . fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the  homeward bound  movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could .  he to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable .  another gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball .  when he was timon in 1994s  the lion king  i would have sworn he was a comedian  and now in  stuart little  he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike .  for the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well .  she fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little .  both make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996s  jerry maguire  .  even though stuart little is completely cgi  the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other .    stuart little  is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter .  we get entertainment  laughs  cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie .  its nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see .  even though it has a $90 million dollar budget im sure it will make over that or just below it respectively .  for all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie  i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know  stuart little  and  toy story 2  are by far the best family films this year .  a winner . ?  , POSas with his other stateside releases  jackie chans latest chopsocky vehicle  mr . nice guy  is contrived  blockheaded  and lacking in narrative logic .  but also like those other films  it is a highly enjoyable ride .  once again  chans screenwriters ( here edward tang and fibe ma ) have taken the easy way out and named their stars character simply jackie  with no last name .  this jackie is a world-class chef who co-hosts a popular cooking show on australian television .  of course  jackie also happens to be a talented martial artist  and these skills come in handy when he becomes involved in an ambitious reporters ( gabrielle fitzpatrick ) expose of a drug dealing ring .  other plot details  involving a videotape and a biker gang  are irrelevant ; in fact  as is the case with most chan films  the plot itself is just about irrelevant .  the sole purpose of mr . nice guys existence are chans comic fight scenes  and those here do not disappoint .  director samo hung ( who has a cameo role )  a longtime collaborator of chans  does not waste any time putting chan in action  diving head-on into a wild chase/fight/shootout after a brief cooking show prologue .  other impressive set pieces follow  most notably a chase in a mall  which directly leads to some frenzied  if cliched ( can you say fruit cart ? )  business involving a runaway carriage ; and an extended late-film sequence at a construction site  in which a hilarious pursuit through a maze of blue doors culminates in some exciting fights involving boards  cement mixers  and a deadly buzzsaw .  none of the action sequences in mr . nice guy are as spectacular as supercops thrilling helicopter-train finale or rumble in the bronxs daring leap between two buildings ; nor is anything as inventive as the ladder fight or air tunnel climax in first strike and operation condor  respectively .  but the action delivers  even if the energy peters out before the films end ( the finale  as spectacular as it is  is a letdown for fans of chans athletic prowess ) .  filmed almost entirely in english ( even so  the voices of some english-speaking actors are laughably dubbed )  mr . nice guy hints at jackie chans latest transition to hollywood productions ( he made ill-fated attempts with 1980s the big brawl and 1985s the protector ) ; next in the pipeline is rush hour  a stateside production co-starring chris tucker .  hopefully that film will be a mere diversion in tinseltown  and chan will continue with exuberant hong kong productions such as mr . nice guy  for his unique charm and reckless abandon are sure to be diluted by american hands  much like they have been before .  , POSthe premise of wag the dog is so simple that its adequately explained by the commercials .  with 11 days to go until the election  the president ( who we never see ) calls in political dirty-tricks artist robert deniro to distract attention from a burgeoning sex scandal .  deniro enlists hollywood producer dustin hoffman to produce a  pageant   a phony war against albania  fought on the blue screens of hollywood and the recording studios of nashville  with woody harrelson as the reluctant  psychotic hero .  and if there wasnt anything more to the movie than this  it would be a second-rate heist comedy at best  enlivened by great actors -- like sneakers goes to washington .   ( a heist comedy ?  yup .  deniro and hoffman are  stealing  the election  so to speak  and the movie is more about how they do it -- and the fun they have doing it -- than anything else . )  wag the dog succeeds because its based one great truth : the american people are stupid .  ok  maybe its not  love thy neighbor as thyself  or even  two plus two makes four   but a truth nonetheless .   ( any average person who thinks that theyre really smart about the two things this movie satirizes -- moviemaking and the political process -- is invited  nay  challenged  to spend a week either watching a movie actually being made or 48 hours straight watching c-span when the house is in session . )  and because were so utterly  predictably stupid  hollywood knows that a certain percentage of us will go see hard rain or magoo  washington knows that we wont notice a few million dollars spent here and there on porno art grants and cigar subsidies -- and deniros character knows that american geography skills are so weak that we wont be able to locate albania on the map .  the beauty of wag the dog is that it isnt a light  meaningless comedy about politics ( like speechless  the michael keaton - geena davis picture ) or from the level of light-hearted politcal satire to near-greatness .  nor is it a hard-edged cynical look at the manner in which a morally-deprived  ethically challenged baby-boomer connives his sleazy way into the white house ( like primary colors -- and yes  i am a little disappointed in the way the last two elections turned out  thanks for asking ) .  instead  david mamets script strikes that delicate balance between comedy and cynicism needed for satire .  it does this by keeping us in a fantasy world where most of the schemers schemes come off beautifully  and fail only in entertaining and humorous fashion .  deniro is playing a variation on his al capone character from the untouchables  without any of the violent rages .  its all :  what do i love ?  what is it that brings me joy ?  baseball   minus the savage bloody beating with the bat .  he threatens a lot of people  mind you  but hes doing it in a very nice  polite way .  its a very mellow  restrained performance  which fits in with the air of gamesmanship in the script .  hoffman  on the other hand  is giddy  exuberant and joyous .  this kind of thing is what his character lives for  and hes so excited that he cant even shut up .  even on the edge of disaster  hes bright-eyed ( behind oddly tinted sunglasses ) and positive .  insiders note that hes basing his character on some powerful-but-anonymous producer -- which may or may not be true  but hoffman still exudes the kind of lets-put-on-a-show electricity that you figure a producer needs to have .  the best part and the most frustrating part of wag the dog is in the supporting cast .  the characters are so well drawn and so well acted that we want to see more of them  listen to them talk in that wised-up mamet dialogue  get to know them better -- which we dont .  anne heche  is dead-bang-on in her portrayal of a political press aide -- cool and composed on the outside  panicked and frenzied on the outside .  denis leary ( one of my favorite actors -- see the ref ) is the  fad king   who handles the profitable  back-end  -- t-shirt tie ins and shoe contracts and other creative  innovative ways to separate a fool from his money .  they could make a whole movie  just about the fad king  and id go see it .  willie nelson and merle haggard handle the musical end of things fabulously  from the upbeat gospel chorus theme song  to the weepy country waltz  to the hilarious  ballad of the green berets  parody .  woody harrelson has a brief  but memorable part as the overmedicated  hero  of the albanian conflict .  craig t . nelson  as the opposition candidate  and the ever-reliable william h . macy  as a wacky cia agent  are given surprisingly short shrift .   ( one of my small gripes is that we never see what the spin doctors on the other side are doing . )  wag the dog is a funny movie about serious problems : the trivialization of american politics  the role of the press in dumbing down the issues  the impact of hollywood in creating campaign commercials  the reduction of all things political to soundbites and sidebars -- the list goes on .  we can solve most of these problems by taking a greater role in our national life and educating ourselves as voters and citizens .  wag the dog reminds us of what can happen if we dont .  , POSas the film opens up  expectant unwed mother sally ( played by drew barrymore ) encounters her babys father in a fast food drive-through window .  after he gets his milkshake  he drives off  only to be pursued by a military helicopter .  from this moment forward  you know that this isnt going to be your run-of-the-mill romantic comedy .  home fries tells the tale of the relationship between sally and dorian ( played by luke wilson )  a helicopter pilot who has a different kind of connection with sally . . . more  than he would care to admit ( hint : it has something to do with the father of sallys unborn child ) .  after taking a personal ( and professional ) interest in her  he finds work at the local fast food restaurant at which she works  and the fun goes on from there .  this movie is a lot of fun .  it is comedic on two levels  as a romantic comedy and a dark comedy .  the romantic moments are sweet  yet not sappy .  one of the more poignant moments is when dorian accompanies sally to lamaze classes .  however  the dark comedic moments are more memorable .  this is also a tale of revenge  and a funny one at that .  the father of sallys unborn child also happened to be a married man  whose wife is played by catherine ohara .  she does a wonderful portrayal of a jealous wife who is targeting the person who had an affair  and is not above getting other people to do her dirty work .   ( my apologies if this sounds cryptic  but there is too much of the plot to give away ) .  rounding out the cast are jake busey as angus  dorians overzealous brother and daryl mitchell as roy  dorians trainer at the fast food restaurant .  the dialogue is sharp and not filled with sappy overtones  even with the romantic nature of the plot .  if there are any complaints  it is over drew barrymores performance .  while she does light up the screen  there are moments when she doesnt seem all that convincing .  the movie was filmed in texas  and most of the characters have southern texan accents .  drew barrymores accent tends to come and go ( luke wilson doesnt seem to have this problem ) .  as well  she seems awfully agile for a woman that is eight months pregnant .  still  this movie is one that will please many viewers .  with plot twists galore and hilarious dark moments  this is sure to entertain .  , POSthe second jackal-based film to come out in 1997 ( the other starring bruce willis was simply entitled the jackal )  this one stars aidan quinn and donald sutherland  and is directed by a man who hailed from joblos own alma matter  concordia university in montreal  canada .  the story is based on the exploits of the real terrorist known as the jackal  but does not pretend to be 100% factual .  plot : naval officer ramirez ( quinn ) gets called upon by the cia to impersonate the international terrorist known as the jackal  in order to put an end to the actual militants radical activities .  he is chosen for this role because he physically resembles the real terrorist to a tee .  ramirez reluctantly agrees to take part in this  assignment   and soon finds himself wrapped up in a true web of international terrorism  intrigue and double-personality syndrome ( which does not sit well with his uninformed wife and kids back in the states . )  critique : great premise is executed with enough style and thrills to keep the piece interesting throughout its close to two-hour runtime .  admittedly  i wasnt a huge fan of any of the main actors in this film  and didnt expect much from this movie beforehand  but surprisingly it did have its thrilling moments  as well as a mostly plausible and absorbing story line .  the first hour is mostly just a build-up of things to come  and does offer a great characterization of the jackal  but the second hour is the one that really cranks in the cool scenes and a sweet ending .  quinn was adequate in both roles as naval officer ramirez and the real jackal  but didnt offer anything extraordinary  in my opinion .  sutherland and kingsley seem to be playing the same role that theyve played in both of their respective careers of late  but nonetheless  appeared to relish the cold-heartedness of their chosen characters .  i didnt like performance put forth from quinns wife in this flick  but then again  she doesnt show up in most of the film  so that wasnt so bad .  i did however enjoy director duguays interesting style and cinematic vision .  this thriller could easily have been boring during many sequences  but duguay always seemed to find something interesting to show the viewer .  i thought that was neat .  having said that  i didnt think the first hour needed to be as long as it was  and the film did have me tinkering on the bridge of believability when the  fake  jackal met with the  real  jackals girlfriend without much retrospection on her part  but all in all  not too many complaints in a movie that could easily be enjoyed by all those who take pleasure in the spy and terrorist thriller genre .  little known facts : ben kingsleys real name is krishna banji  he stands 5  8  was born in scarborough  england  and won the best actor honor in 1982s academy awards presentation for the title role he portrayed in ghandi .  many scenes from this film were actually shot in montreal  canada ( joblos haven of restfulness ) .  donald sutherland has fathered actor kiefer sutherland  is canadian  and apparently still owns a place in the north of montreal .  , POSone of the last entries in the long-running carry on series  carry on behind is very similar to carry on camping in that it involves a group of holidaymakers descending on a caravan site .  professors anna vrooshka ( elke sommer ) and roland crump ( kenneth williams ) and a group of archaeology students stay in the caravan site owned by major leep ( kenneth connor ) so that they can explore the nearby roman settlement remains .  anna has a little trouble understanding english and sometimes people get the wrong end of the stick : - for instance  when anna is asking for scrubbers for dirty caravan  she means that she wants a scrubbing brush to clean the caravan !  arthur upmore ( bernard bresslaw ) and his wife linda ( patsy rowlands ) take her mother daphne barnes ( joan sims ) and her minah bird on holiday with them .  mother-in-law jokes prevail .  furthermore  the trouble that joe and norma baxter ( ian lavender and adrienne posta ) have with their large irish greyhound allows for some comical moments between the two families .  fred ramsden ( windsor davies ) and ernie bragg ( jack douglas ) leave their wives ( liz fraser and patricia franklin ) behind for a fishing holiday .  however  they have more in mind than fishing when they catch sight of two young girls  sandra ( carol hawkins ) and carol ( sherrie hewson ) .  the story involves the disruption caused by the archaeological professors of the day-to-day running of the camp  the search for the minah bid and greyhound  the major  fred and ernies desperate need of a woman  a misunderstanding leading to a striptease at the caravan parks pub  and a shock in store for daphne .  the partnership between sommer and williams is very effective and amusing .  this is what binds the movie together .  joan sims stands out as the demanding mother-in-law  bernard bresslaw and patsy rowlands work well together as husband and wife  and carol hawkins and sherrie hewson are a welcome addition to the cast .  on the other hand  there are low-key performances from kenneth connor and peter butterworth as barnes the handyman  and there are very poor performances by windsor davies and jack douglas who spend far too much time on the screen !  even though there is no real plot to speak of and the jokes are getting bluer due to the new scriptwriter dave freeman  there are enough truly comical moments and bright and breezy performances to lift this carry on above many of its predecessors .  although the regular cast is depleted  the ones that remain show that they can still make a good carry on film .  a relative flop at the cinema  this movie deserves a lot more recognition .  , POSthe cryptic teaser trailer has been unspooling in moviehouses for quite sometime now :  it mu5t be found .   so what  exactly  is the fifth element ?  after seeing luc bessons ambitious  much-shrouded-in-secrecy science fiction fantasy  i could not help but be let down by the actual answer  which is not nearly as exciting nor clever as one would think .  but what is far from a letdown is the film as a whole  a wildly imaginative feast for the senses that does what all the best science fiction films do--create a universe unlike any other presented on the silver screen .  the biggest irony of the fifth element is that the one thing that has been kept under such tight wraps--the actual storyline--is the most conventional  dismayingly so  element ( pun intended ) of the film .  speaking in the vaguest possible terms  the basics of the plot are as follows : in the year 2259  a great force of evil threatens to consume the earth  and only the four elements--earth  wind  fire  and water--united with a fifth element can stop it .  figuring into all of this are new york cabbie korben dallas ( bruce willis ) ; a shady  southern-drawling entrepreneur by the name of zorg ( the hilariously hammy gary oldman  picking up where he left off in bessons the professional ) ; a priest ( ian holm ) ; and a mysterious creature named leeloo ( milla jovovich ) .  all of the pieces come together in a tidy and somewhat underwhelming--and unsurprising--fashion  but there is no denying that this basic story holds some intrinsic interest .  what remains interesting and exciting  however  after brief glimpses is the fascinating world besson has created with production designer dan weil  director of photography thierry arbogast  visual effects supervisor mark stetson  and the crew at digital domain .  the look is absolutely mesmerizing right from the opening moments to the last .  the frenzied cityscape of new york  with its vibrant day-glo colors  tall buildings penetrating high into the clouds  and the swarm of cars  cabs  and other vehicles flying through labyrinthian skyways  is absolutely breathtaking to behold  especially in a wild car chase sequence early on in the film .  but it would not have been a completely captivating vision if the people inhabiting the settings werent equally as interesting  and are they ever .  in addition to the exotic menagerie of alien creatures that populate this world  from bulky robots to dog-like mangalores  the humans are outfitted in costumes by eccentric designer jean-paul gaulthier  best known for creating madonnas pointy bustier get-up in her blonde ambition tour .  gaulthiers outlandish creations  such as a number worn by leeloo made entirely out of white straps  feel more at home in bessons futuristic vision than on any fashion runway in the world ; they add to the sense of otherworldliness about the film .  while bessons bold vision is the biggest virtue of the film  it also could be its biggest obstacle to reaching a mass audience .  for all its imagination  certain things about the film may be a bit too quirky and bizarre .  i really do not know what middle america will make of the most outrageous character of the film  ruby rhod ( chris tucker )  a flamboyant disc jockey who makes dennis rodman look conservative--he makes a raucous entrance dressed in an animal print dress  sporting a blonde hairdo in the shape of a hair dryer  speaking in high pitches at rapid fire speed .  at first this characters hyper energy is funny  but the act wears out its welcome very quickly .  not irritating  but just as strange  is a musical number by blue-skinned alien chanteuse diva ( maiwenn lebesco )  who sings--and dances--an aria that is an unlikely blend of classical opera and techno .  the tune  as with the entirety of longtime besson collaborator eric serras innovative score  is haunting  but it is also completely jarring .  then there are the campy touches of humor besson and co-scripter robert mark kamen sprinkle throughout  which too often are silly and forced ; a comic sexual encounter between ruby rhod and a flight attendant is highly distracting and not very funny  to boot .  the storys weakness shines through in the climax and conclusion of the fifth element .  while still visually and aurally spectacular  the events detailed are not as exciting nor powerful as they should be .  the big  serious dramatic climax was met with more than a few snickers  and it ambitiously strives for a profundity which the film had not even begun to work toward .  as such  at the end there is a sense that there was something bigger at work here  that there was still more left to be said about this story and these characters .  this suspicion was confirmed by besson himself  who told me in the lobby following the screening ( imagine that  the filmmaker watching the film with the  enemy  --the critics ) that what had made it to the screen was really just the first half of the lengthy original fifth element screenplay and that the second half--now titled mr . shadow--is still waiting to be made .  still  despite the story problems  the fifth element is an artistic triumph for luc besson ; rarely does a filmmakers original vision come to the screen in all its audacious  undiluted glory .  it is a fascinating example of how of one artists fervid imagination can transport an audience into an intoxicating fantasy world generally seen only in dreams .  , POS  very bad things   is the most delightfully morbid film of the year  a movie that goes so far over the deep end with its outrageousness and violence that i couldnt help but be won over by the material .  the film starts off with five friends leaving their homes in los angeles for a bachelor party in las vegas .  the groom-to-be is kyle fisher ( jon favreau )  who is about to be married to the controlling  wedding-obsessed laura ( cameron diaz ) .  the other friends are real estate agent robert boyd ( christian slater )  quiet charles ( leland orser )  and brothers  michael ( jeremy piven ) and family man adam ( daniel stern ) .  after a wild night of gambling  boozing  and drugs  a stripper ( carla scott ) who was paid for by robert comes into their hotel room  but after a freak accident  to everyones terror  she is killed .  as robert puts it :  there are two options : go to the police and go to prison  or bury her out in the desert where no one will ever find her .   after a security guard enters into the hotel room unexpectantly and sees the body  robert is forced to kill him as well .    okay  there is only one option now .  you can forget about calling the police   he says .  by the time the five friends return home and as the wedding draws nearer  most of them are overcome with guilt  which sets off an even more elaborate series of event  that includes much  much more murder  double-crosses  and the inevitable wedding from hell .    very bad things   which is actor peter bergs feature film directing debut  is the shockingly perverse and wicked comedy that   theres something about mary   wanted to be .  it pulls out all the stops to create something fresh  original  and hilarious  even if that requires surprisingly graphic violence  gore  and a slew of truly hateful characters that all get what they deserve by the end .  the screenplay  also written by berg  is  to put it mildly  very funny and courageous .  during the second act of the film  some of the fun was beginning to slightly dwindle due to so much death  which was beginning to undermine the humor  but it eventually recouped itself with a climax that has to be seen to be believed .  the dialogue is edgy and inventive  and this film proves that a movie doesnt necessarily require likable character to be extremely enjoyable .  theres more fun  i think  in showing ignorable people getting their just desserts .  cameron diaz gives her best performance to date here  and has a lot of fun in playing the hateful laura  who eventually turns out to be more crazy than any of the five male friends .  diaz puts so much overblown energy to her character that i really do think she deserves a supporting actress oscar nomination come next january .  by the time she is beating someone to death with a coat hanger  and reciting lines like   stuff him in the crapper and get your ass upstairs   i couldnt help but crack up at how  balls-to-the-wall  this film had become .  jeanne tripplehorn creates another character original  as daniel sterns wife  who late in the picture  we discover  is a tough kick-boxer that should not be messed around with .  it is at this level that   very bad things   was so entertaining and surprising .  just when you thought you could predict what was going to happen  there would be a little twist involving the characters that would be absolutely wacky .  the last sequence was perfect and managed to go even further over-the-top .  although i enjoyed the film immensely  let me make this clear :  very bad things   is not a movie for everyone .  it is more tasteless than anything i have ever seen  it is more violent and bloody than a r-rated film usually is  and it is offensive .  luckily  these are elements that i would prefer in a comedy  since it clearly shows the filmmakers were set on making a no-holds-barred  politically incorrect comedy .  the fact that this film slipped through the cracks of the usually mainstream and  safe  wide-releases coming out lately  still gives me hope for the hollywood film industry .  , POSit is hard to imagine that a movie which includes abortion and incest as prominent plot devices could be so sensitive  so delicate  so insightful and yes  even so enjoyable .  somehow  the cider house rules manages to keep an even keel in the face of the harsh subject matter and allows a substantial amount of heart to shine through .  set in the 1940s  the film tells the story of a unique young man named homer wells ( tobey maguire  ride with the devil ) .  an orphan  twice rejected as an infant by possible adoptive parents  he grows up in the care and under the tutelage of dr . wilbur larch ( michael caine  little voice )  father figure to the orphans of st . cloud  obstetrician or abortionist to the unhappily pregnant women who come there seeking his help .  figuring that as long as homer was going to stay at the orphanage  he might as well be of use  dr . larch begins teaching him all he knows about obstetrics .  soon homer is delivering babies like a professional .  he refuses to perform abortions  instead wondering why the couples just didnt behave more responsibly .  larch  too old and experienced to have such youthful ideals  marvels that homer  continues to have such high expectations of people .   such is the result of an insulated upbringing .  though skilled in certain medical procedures  homer remains woefully naive and ignorant about most everything else .  he finally figures that in order to find his place in the world  he must go out into it .  befriending a young couple who had come to see dr . larch  he hitches a ride with them and parlays that into landing a job as an apple picker with a group of black migrant workers at the orchard where they lived .  thus  homer begins his worldly instruction  with new friend candy kendall ( charlize theron  the astronauts wife ) a willing tutor .  tobey maguire is well cast yet again as an inherently good man who is seeking answers to lifes questions . . .  many of which he was unaware needed to be asked .  he demonstrates a quiet strength and thoughtful curiosity that is both warm and appealing .  michael caine is  in a word  brilliant as the caring caretaker of these orphans  many of whom he helped to bring into the world .  calling them  princes of maine  kings of new england  in his ritualistic goodnight  mr . caine manages to communicate the love and commitment larch has towards these children without becoming maudlin or saccharine .  delroy lindo ( a life less ordinary ) has many powerful moments as mr . rose  the strong and charismatic leader of the apple pickers whom homer joins .  director lasse hallstrom ( whats eating gilbert grape ? ) and screenwriter/novelist john irving ( the world according to garp )  who adapted his own work for this movie deserve much of the credit for the balanced approach to the sensitive subject matter .  regardless of ones personal stand on the divisive matter of abortion  it is hard to imagine anyone becoming offended by the evenhanded treatment used by these filmmakers .  the title is a reference to a list of rules posted in the quarters of the illiterate apple pickers .  figuring the rules didnt apply to them since they didnt have a hand in writing them  they decide to ignore the list and make up their own rules as they go along .  dr . larch  in his own way  acts similarly .  there is a danger in that line of reasoning .  god has also given us a set of rules .  unlike the list posted in the cider house  gods rules  if followed  promise us benefits beyond our imagination .  and yet  many continue to ignore his  rules  preferring to make up their own as they go through life .    trust in the lord with all thine heart ; and lean not unto thine own understanding .   proverbs 3 : 5 [kjv]  just as a builder follows a designers blueprint or a conductor follows a composers score  why shouldnt we follow the rules of life given to us by lifes architect for our own blessing ?  , POSknown as the most successful  highest-grossing romantic comedy in history  director garry marshall apparently struck gold with  pretty woman   which opened quietly during the summer of 1990 but  thanks to positive word-of-mouth  was able to reach upwards of $175-million in theaters alone .  the question of why it worked so well lies directly with the films two charismatic stars  richard gere and julia roberts  since the story itself is none too original or even believable .  the other winning element that makes  pretty woman  so entertaining is its genuine sweetness and innocence  which is rarely as palpable in todays films as it is here .  edward lewis ( richard gere ) is a suave  extremely wealthy business mogul who  at the start of the picture  breaks up with his girlfriend over the phone after a nasty argument  and abruptly takes his friends car and gets lost on hollywood boulevard while trying to find his hotel .  stopping the car along the street  he asks a woman  obviously a prostitute  for directions .  agreeing to get in his car and show him for ten bucks  edward ultimately accepts  they strike up a conversation  and before long she has been asked up to his penthouse room on the top floor .  this meeting does not lead to sex  however  as edward confides that hed rather just have someone to talk to  and offers her $300 to spend the night .  just as well  since the hooker  named vivian  is a beautiful  generally upbeat young woman who is the type of person that can lend an understanding ear .  the meeting between these two completely opposite people does not end the next morning as planned  when edward finally offers to pay vivian three-thousand dollars if she will stay with him for six days and nights while he is in the area  keeping him company and acting as his companion to business dinners and get-togethers .  since vivian firmly tells edward at the beginning that she will do anything with him except kiss him on the lips  which always leads to unwanted intimacy when dealing with her customers  the obligatory rule of the genre says that by the third act  edward and vivian will finally  truly  kiss .  allegedly planned as a grim  downbeat drama until garry marshall came on board as director   pretty woman  has been transformed in all senses of the word into a classic fairy tale  a la  cinderella .   the premise is hardly believable and its portrait of prostitutes hanging out on the streets of hollywood boulevard is just about the most idealized portrayal that there could have possibly been .  you honestly dont need a high-iq ( or any iq  for that matter ) to guess how the film will end  and the story is as old as my great great grandma bertha .  the supporting characters are almost all sketchily written and less-than-gratifying  and the screenplay is no award winner .  and yet  amidst all of these qualms and flaws   pretty woman  is an astoundingly charming motion picture  and it is definately easy to see why it became such an overnight sensation with moviegoers .  youd actually be amazed how far bemusement can go  and there are a few select moments ( not even whole scenes  mind you ) that are as romantic as anything ive seen on film in the 1990s .  additionally  the film belongs  and its success can be attributed  to two people and two people only  and they are richard gere and julia roberts .  playing sex symbols throughout the 80s with such pictures as  american gigolo  and  an officer and a gentleman   gere branches out here to play a more quiet  almost shy  but still alluring  character that believably could sweep julia roberts off her feet  and vice versa .  julia roberts  in her breakthrough role after 1988s well-received  mistic pizza  and 1989s  steel magnolia   for which she was nominated for an academy award  is radiant and funny as the wordly vivian  who surprisingly could be a role model for impressionistic viewers  not for her line of work  but more for her sheer intelligence .  it would have probably been easy to have written vivian as merely a flake  but screenwriter j . f . lawton clearly cared too much about his central characters to do such a thing .  after  pretty woman   roberts  along with meg ryan  became the reigning queen of romantic comedies ( with her latest being the just-released  runaway bride   which repairs gere and roberts together once again )  and no wonder .  roberts has continually proven to not only be a strong actress with a flare for comedy  but also one who can efficiently do drama  and in almost every film she appears in  it is difficult not to fall in love with her along with her male co-star .  an especially strong scene that gere and roberts do together takes place after edward foolishly tells one of his co-workers that vivian is actually a prostitute  and he then approaches her  making sexual advances .  no only does this make vivian feel cheap  especially since she had previously been posing as a more professional  eloquent young lady  but it also maddens her that edward would demean and betray her in such a way  and ultimately causes her to question where exactly her life is leading  and if she likes this particular path .  on the more dreamy side  the film is filled with romantic scenes that are simply effervescent to behold  especially one in which edward enters into the hotels lounge to see vivian turn around and not only reveal her marvelous cocktail dress  but also her inner ( and outer ) glowing beauty .  another subtle moment has vivian lovingly blowing a kiss to edward  who is asleep  and placing it on his lips  since she still is unsure if she should be getting attached to this man who may very well be out of her life forever in a short couple of days .    pretty woman  does not blatantly step wrong until the very last scene  which is a happy ending ( as youd expect  and wouldnt have it any other way ) that somehow does not work  perhaps because of its undeniable contrivances .  this one misstep does not put a damper on the rest of the film  though  because there is just far too much magic at work here to disaffirm such a petty problem .  helped along by a warm  memorable supporting performance from laura san giacomo  as vivians best friend and roommate  and a fabulously catchy soundtrack  in which all of the songs prominently aid in the movies overall fulfillment   pretty woman  is a sparkler of a motion picture  and has what it takes to act as a blueprint on how to make the quintessential romantic comedy .  , POSthe dramatic comedy cousins has all the necessary ingredients : a witty and whimsical script  inspired performances  a great sense of humor  a large and wonderful cast  and the beautiful scenery of vancouver .  its a movie of weddings  marriage  family  infidelity  and--oh yes--love .  like 3 men and a baby  cousins is an americanized version of a french film : 1975s cousin  cousine .  the plot is complicated  but it goes something like this .  larry and tom are cousins  each of whom is not-so-happily-married .  tom starts an affair with larrys wife  tish  and to get even  larry and toms wife  maria  pretend to have an affair of their own .  soon the pretending turns to love and cousins is off and running .  cousins is populated by a wide assortment of interesting characters and caricatures .  the acting is first rate down to even the smallest supporting role  and virtually every performance deserves mention .  ted danson ( in his first starring film role ) finally gets to play a character with some depth and sensitivity .  while larry may be confident and charming like sam malone on  cheers   he is also complex and vulnerable  with more between his ears than empty space .  as maria  isabella rossellini is a joy to watch ; she is shy  sensuous  and immensely alluring .  sean young is perfectly cast as larrys picture perfect wife  tish  a superficial and trendy make-up consultant .  keith coogan  from adventures in babysitting  is wonderfully weird and eccentric as larrys rebellious son  mitch .  and finally  lloyd bridges in a tour de force performance is mitchs rambunctious grandfather ; he provides some of cousins best lines and laughs .  like moonstruck  cousins is a mix of drama and comedy .  the film is larger than life and has a keen sense of the absurd .  it understands human nature extremely well and milks it for every possible laugh and heart-tug .  how often do you see a movie where you believe that two characters truly and sincerely care for and love each other  as friends and as lovers ?  well  to its credit  cousins is just such a movie .  lets hope the french continue to provide us with the inspiration to make films like cousins  , POSthis remake of  la cage aux folles  features a gay couple pretending to be straight in order to pull the wool over the eyes of their sons future in-laws .  the couple ( robin williams and nathan lane ) are about as archetypal  or as the less kind might put it ? stereotypical  gays possible .  williams owns a nightclub featuring drag queens where his partner performs as the featured star .  they live above the club in what could not possibly be mistaken as a heterosexual abode .  williams is excellent as should be no surprise .  gene hackman as right-wing potential father-in-law is refreshing in one of his few comedic roles .  the real star is lane .  his attempted transformation from one of the most obviously gay men in the world to the straight-shooting uncle is hilarious .  perhaps it is a personal failing on my part  but the crying and screaming drag queen faux high drama just grates on my nerves and the first few minutes of this film are filled with it .  luckily ( for me at least )  it doesnt last long and the rest of the story focuses on the relationship between the men  their son and the deception .  the question of stereotypes is a touchy one .  these guys personify the homophobic gay image .  you can almost hear the swishing .  if you think that they are supposed to be representative of every gay man in the world  youll be outraged .  but if you can accept the view is that this is a movie about gay individuals  youll love it .  your choice .  , POSseen may 19  1999 at 5 p . m . at the crossgates cinema 18 ( guilderland  n . y . )  theater #1  with my brother john for $8 . 50 .  [theater rating : * * * * : excellent seats  sound and picture]   ( critics note : this review is the longest ive ever written and still only scratches the surface .  id recommend this be read only by those who have seen the film as a form of critical analysis . )  as my friend and fellow film critic ted prigge said in his review of `the phantom menace - how do i even write this review ?  never mind the fact that ive been waiting for a new `star wars movie since i was seven years old .  never mind the fact everyone on the internet had already dissected and discussed the movie before it was even released .  never mind that theres so much going on in this movie in terms of plot  action  special effects and long-term story that to analyze every aspect would take a lot of time and energy and still wouldnt cover everything .  and also like ted does in all of his reviews  ill try to review this in a way different from my usual reviews and instead write as casually as possible as if i was talking directly to you  the reader .  before we can begin analyzing the specific aspects of the film  many of the most general and most significant factors must be considered ( to get the specifics of the film  skip this and the next four paragraphs ) .  as has been made obvious for the last several years  another trilogy of films will be produced to account for the [missing] initial three installments of the `star wars series ( the first of the films was actually episode four  not one ) .  george lucas  the creator of the series  has probably just assumed most people know the first-produced trilogy ( `star wars   `the empire strikes back and `return of the jedi ) is actually the second trilogy  chronologically .  in media interviews in the past he has explained why the movies were made out of order  but i cant recall his reasons .  with this new film he as writer and director has also assumed viewers are at least vaguely familiar with the storylines and significant plot points of the first trilogy ( err . . .  second trilogy . . .  well you know what i mean ) .  and in order for this review to be thorough many of those significant points must be mentioned which  unfortunately  may serve as spoilers so proceed with caution .  [critics note #1 : it is one my personal policy not to intentionally analyze spoilers because i would like my reviews to be able to make sense to the reader both before and after viewing the film reviewed  but it would be nearly impossible to do the film justice here without breaking the rule .  critics note #2 : reviewing this film also breaks the universal critics law of reviewing movies  which as roger ebert coined  `its not what a movie is about  but how it is about it .   because so many outside factors come into play in the films plot and significance as part of a trilogy  and just considering modern society  it again would be difficult  if not impossible to simply review the film as a completely autonomous story . ]  first of all we have to catalog what we know about the film before even going into it .  we know that young anakin skywalker will grow up to become the evil ruler darth vader who is also the father of luke skywalker  who will lead a successful revolution against him and his empire .  we know obi-wan `ben kenobi was the trainer of anakin in the ways of `the force in attempts to become a jedi knight  but would fail and thus anakin would fall to the `dark side .   we also know something about `the force itself  that it is some kind of universal force which determines fate and can be manipulated by those whose minds are expanded enough to believe in it and feel it ( the jedi ) .  what we dont know for sure is the history of the ruling of the galaxy  which is most likely much longer and more complex than any government we have had here on earth .  to me  this was one of the most fascinating aspects of the first three films because there seemed to be a subtle  definite order to all the complexity .  also  it seems that were supposed to be familiar with a few other details about the story which have come out of the thousands of comic books and paperbacks published in the years since the movies ended .  most notably  details regarding the emperor from `empire and `jedi   and that he was once a senator and his last name is palpatine .  for those who havent kept up with all the `star wars paraphernalia over the years  there is still a way to know these details simply by recognizing an actor ( or his voice at least ) .  with `the phantom menace being the first chapter of a long saga  one would assume the basic groundwork would be laid  including the history behind all the major factors of the series  especially `the force and the jedi knights .  unfortunately  this film does more of the opposite as it simply builds on top of what must be a history so long and detailed it could never be explained .  i didnt liked that aspect to this film and is one of the reasons it falls just short of greatness .  if youre going to tell a story from the beginning - tell it from the beginning ( is it possible that after this trilogy is complete there could be another trilogy of episodes -1 through -3 to clarify the back story even further ? ) .  but i digress .  ive said so much and yet i havent even touched on the specifics of the film itself .  all these necessary `disclaiming elements should go to show just how vast the story of the `star wars series is and this individual film itself .  what we get here is a movie not unlike any of the other three weve come to know and love since the late 1970s .  its similarity to the other films helps to keep the spirit of the series familiar  but at the same time seems to be a flaw in the filmmaking process itself since it sometimes rings of unoriginality .  the basic story is rather sorted  complex and even confusing at times .  were told that an army known as `the trade federation has set up a blockade around an seemingly insignificant planet called naboo .  were not given too many details to clarify the back story of what the federation is and what their purpose is  instead the film opts to get its story moving quickly .  were introduced to two jedi  the master qui-gon jinn ( neeson ) and his apprentice obi-wan kenobi ( mcgregor ) .  the two are acting as ambassadors of some sort in hopes of ending the obvious hostility between the federation and the planets queen  amidala ( portman ) .  the leader of the federation  an alien called viceroy  is following the orders of a strange  mythical character - an older human man whose face and body are covered and shadowed by the black robe and hood he wears .  he is referred to as lord sidious but considering his appearance  and especially that creepy evil voice of his  he is a obviously one of the most significant characters in the series .  sidious communicates to viceroy only through digital transmissions and never in person .  clearly his actual whereabouts are something he wants to keep secret because that would also reveal his identity ( which is never openly revealed in the film  but should be clear to most viewers .  i have a feeling well delve into his background in the next two films ) .  but it doesnt take the film long to spring into action and within minutes our hero jedi are fighting for their lives and the films story begins to move along .  the film doesnt have one specific plot and works in the same manner as the other films in the series where as what we get is one mini-plot and adventure on top of another .  there are so many of these mini-plots-within-plots in this film i would not describe them all because it is what gives the movie its hook .  the other films have relied on this type of storytelling  but because of the limits of the technology at the time  the films screenplays were also limiting .  the sense of limitlessness here is what gives `the phantom menace its unique traits .  as we already know  the film takes place at least a generation or two before the original `star wars trilogy which means a lot of the background which was unclear and/or unexplained may be cleared up here as it is the beginning of the vast epic story .  and here the most significant storyline is that involving the discovery of 10-year-old anakin skywalker ( lloyd )  by qui-gon jinn and his introduction to the jedi council .  to briefly summarize the story  jinn stumbles upon skywalker in an attempt to buy parts for queen amidalas spaceship which was damaged in efforts to free her from the federation .  their meeting on tatooine is mostly chance but of course jinn chalks it up to the will of the force .  jinn can feel that skywalker has a great natural power in the force  and through another sub-plot involving a bet on skywalker in a fantastic race he will enter  more and more details of his significance begin to reveal themselves .  this also provides for a new elaboration and explanation of the force which has never been mentioned before .  in fact  it seems to be something so important it is upsetting it has never been mentioned before .  the element seriously undermines the mystical aspect of the force and transforms it into something more physical and scientific which is completely unnecessary .  by the films third act all the major significant elements become tied together in a rather familiar execution of the plot .  its funny how the reality of the `star wars world seems so embedded in mythology  new age-like philosophy and religion and yet the solution to all the major conflicts in the series has been violence .  not that this technique hasnt been used in movies and in real-life situations countless times throughout history .  and at least its all in the spirit of the ultimate powers of good versus evil in a fun and exciting matter .  it does border of the cartoonish sometimes  but thats just the film appealing to our inner child  which is the basic reason the entire saga exists and has become such a big part of our modern society .  `the phantom menace delivers exactly what youd expect from a `star wars film which is why it succeeds as well as it does but is always why it never truly achieves greatness .  so many things in the film weve seen before and done with more heart because the filmmakers concentrated just a bit more on story and character because they were limited .  but this film is far from bad because it at least embraces the spirit of sheer fun at the movies .  , POSthe story of us  a rob reiner film  is the second movie this fall that touches the viewer in a way they are rarely touched by a film  as they can see their everyday lives in the usually once in a year films .  well  1999 has two of them  the other being the instant classic about a very dysfunctional family  american beauty .  the story of us  a film about the highs and lows of marriage and family  is a well written  heartbreaking and insightful film that made the majority of the audience  including myself  cry .  the story of us tells the story of ben ( bruce willis ) and katie ( michelle pfeiffer ) jordan  and asks the question   can a marriage survive 15 years of marriage ?   the film is about two individuals who have come together  spent a good chunk of their lives together  and shows when our main characters are  him  and  her  ( during the bad times )  and when they are  us  ( during the good times ) .  the story of us is about their entire 15 years of marriage that is collapsing day by day .  ben and katie now only see and live with each other because they dont want to devastate their children with the fact that their parents no longer  or at least say they dont  love each other anymore .  ben  a cartoonist  and katie  a crossword puzzle writer  have grown apart during their fifteen years of marriage  as they have grown to follow different views on life  family  and marriage .  katie is the more organized  sophisticated type  who wants to plan everything out  while ben is a spontaneous  adventurous individual who doesnt mind doing things differently than they were planned .  the story of us plays out nicely  as the film opens with ben sharing his story with a therapist  told to the viewer through flashbacks .  as the film progresses  it switches between ben and katie talking to their therapist  with their stories being told with flashbacks of their marriage .  this method is highly effective  as we see the characters changing from year to year  slowly growing apart .  through the flashbacks  we get to see the story of them through both of the characters eyes  and this gives us a strong sense of what their characters are really like  as the story of us has three dimensional  believable main characters .  the screenplay  written by jessie nelson ( stepmom ) and alan zweibel ( dragnet )  is a touching  down to earth work that hits a chord within the viewer  much like another one of nelsons films  stepmom .  the script has an open honesty and outlook on life  one that is so realistic  you feel uncomfortable at many times  because so many situations the characters are in are undeniably familiar  as most families these days most go through the hard times  as ben and katie must .  if it wasnt for the first 15 minutes that the writers wrote  which are rugged and certainly flawed  the story of us would have been this years best picture .  bruce willis  a usual action/adventure star  has certainly turned himself around in the past year- he went from being a man who was being typecast to the same role in action movies  to a distinguished  sophisticated actor  as in last summers the sixth sense ; and now in the story of us  willis shows the world what he can really do if he is fed a good script .  although i wouldnt pick willis as the choice actor for ben jordan  willis handles himself nicely  and shines in a few of the films most powerful scenes  enough that make his performance a definite contender comes awards season .  where to start about michelle pfeiffer ?  pfeiffers performance is spellbinding and ultimately strong  as she brings her character to life with such charisma and emotion  you wonder how  how it is possible for someone to portray a real person with such realism .  pfeiffers performance is one that if not recognized by the academy next spring  will be in the hearts of any viewer that has watched this moving film .  the story of us is one of 1999s most real  yet funny films  as the razor sharp script evens out the laughs and the tears to keep the viewer hooked .  superb acting  direction  writing  story  and soundtrack that always sets the mood for the film  which is beautifully composed by eric clapton and marc shaiman  make the story of us a touching  unforgettable motion picture that will touch the hearts of viewers across the country- and will certainly become one of the most talked about movies of the fall .  the films major high points are the fights between ben and katie  as the two constantly accuse of each other of whose fault it is that their marriage has collapsed  and although they also say things like  its over   or  i hate you   you can tell the two still share a deep connection  and that inside  somewhere  they are still an  us .   the bottom line : a wonderful  enchanting  and heartbreaking film .  one of the most realistic  heartbreaking films in recent years .  , POSwarren beatty returns to the screens in the funniest  craziest and hard hitting movie in his career .  based on a story concocted by himself  and also written by beatty  bulworth gives a good insight of what beatty thinks of the american government system .  beatty stars as senator jay bulworth  whos going through a nervous breakdown .  after hiring someone to kill him  he completely changes his campaign strategy and tells the honest truth about whats _really_ happening in american politics  much to the annoyance of assistant dennis murphy ( platt . )  instead of everyone hating him  the american public love him .  however  inside his party  more people want to kill him than just the hired assassin .  and he also strikes a relationship with black girl nina ( berry . )  its remarkable that this film was released at all .  much more open than the rather subdued primary colours  bulworth barely gives the american politic system a good name .  the outrageous remarks bulworth makes to his potential voters are very funny  and also somewhat true .  its great that beatty isnt afraid to let loose on a subject .  talking of beatty  hes excellent in the role of the demented senator  clearing having fun .  and seeing warren beatty have fun is a rare sight indeed .  even in dick tracy  he was the most straighten face actor .   ( then again  he was the only characters face we could completely see . )  the film gives an opportunity for the 61 year old beatty to indulge in some rapping  which he does with gusto ( and also quite well . )  and seeing beatty as a homeboy has to be seen to be believed .  its nice to see that beatty can laugh at himself .  second best is oliver platt as the flustered  coke snorting assistant  who goes over the top when he finally snaps .  halle berry is fine  and sexy  as the intellectual nina  who comes to like the senator .  also popping up in the supporting cast is paul sorvino wit h a strange accent  laurie metcalf as the exact same characters shes also played  and christine baranski of cybill fame as bullworths wife  who all contribute to the fun .  and  this being a political film  the ubiquitous larry king makes an appearance  as  * shock *  himself .  the writing and directing  both by beatty  are above par .  the direction is very nearly sitcom like  but suits the film perfectly  and both the politics are gangland parts are handled well .  the script is funny  and the raps are actually well produced and humorous  and quite clever .  theyre not cringe inducing  at least .  the script makes many points about society in america today  and isnt afraid to make any bold statements about what is a flawed system .  best of all  the film is thought provoking  but directed and written in such a way that the film feels as light as a feather  and is very entertaining .  theres also a great rap soundtrack with some well chosen tunes .  bulworth is a film with many advantages  and few flaws .  perhaps it could be somewhat embarrassing to see a 61 year old man rapping  but beatty does it so well its irrelevant .  in fact  theres very little against bulworth  except for the language which is very heavy  but then again it should be expected .  bulworth  then  is well worth watching .  a david wilcock review ? 1999    you know  for kids  - norville barnes  , POSthe long and illustrious career of robin williams  which has included both forgettable turns like mrs .  doubtfire and flubber  was punctuated with the actors first academy award in 1998 for his role in good will hunting .  it was his first truly dramatic role since 1989s dead poets society  and critical remarks were unanimously positive .  his next role  that of a deceased pediatrician in what dreams may come  was unfortunately lackluster .  and so  after a six-year stint as a comedic actor  the proof on whether or not williams can cut it in the dramatic league has come down to patch adams .  williams is the title character  hunter  patch  adams  sporting scruffy facial hair that falls between the clean-shavenness of dreams and the grotesque hairiness of will hunting .  were introduced to patch as he commits himself to a mental institution because of his suicidal tendancies .  its at the institution  however  that he discovers a latent talent for relating to people .  he removes himself from the institution and enrolls at the university of virginias medical college  where he finds that medical doctrine is a calculating  impersonal trade .  his attempts to inject humanity into the profession result in several bouts with expulsion  and the movie climaxes with patchs appearance before the state medical board .  the characters are well-defined in an oscar-worthy sense .  although the script does not perform well as a narrative -- theres little story to be told outside of patchs skit-length experiences -- the script does go a long way toward building the relationships of characters .  at medical school  patch meets up with truman schiff ( daniel london )  an outsider like himself who relishes patchs zest for humanity .  the two instantly become the best of friends  and its easy to see why .  monica potter plays patchs love interest  a young woman who personifies the things that patch hates about medical school .  for some reason hes attracted to her  and although it never gets said  the audience understands from an intrinsic point of view .  the script -- based on hunter adams own story -- works well this way .  the rest of the cast  bob gunton as the villain professor in particular  is solid .  director tom shadyac ( liar liar ) leads us in and out of patchs life in a sound  intentional manner ; combined with williams presence on screen  the movie rarely becomes boring .  patch adams lack of purpose is its major shortcoming  and for the first ninety minutes out of two hours  theres little feeling of continuity or the passage of time .  nevertheless  its an emotionally moving picture  and patch adams looks to be one of the more memorable of the holiday season .  it succeeds at everything it tries  and only fails at the stuff it doesnt try in the first place .  by and large there may be another oscar nomination herein for williams  but more importantly  its entertainment for the entire family .  , POS  have you ever heard the one about a movie so bad that it made a guy run out of the theatre screaming ?   obviously the producers at columbia tristar did not think that we suffered enough from the first installment  and so to finish us utterly  they have now released  urban legends : final cut  .  this is another  scream  -like feature  consisting merely from the recycled materials of rip-offs from the most pointless movies of all time .  amy ( jennifer morrison ) is a film student who is attending a film school filled with uninspired film students who do not have a clue about what to do .  but just as she reaches the halfway mark of her final semester at prestigious universitys film program -- where each years best thesis production takes the coveted hitchcock prize  a virtual one-way ticket to hollywood success -- she has a chance encounter with campus security guard reese ( loretta devine )  whose tale of a series of murders based on urban legends at another university inspires amy to try her hand at a fictional thriller organized along similar lines .  soon enough  fake -- and real -- blood starts to flow  and amy is being chased around by scary killer  while her cast and crew get slain  one by one .  is the culprit the original urban legends murderer  just some random psycho  !  a member of the faculty  one of her competitors for the hitchcock  or is there something even more stupid going on ?  this is another one of those tiring  pointless teen slasher flicks : neither scary  funny  or interesting .  it simply lacks the ability and the story to entertain .  the body counts and screams continue to grow  as the weak level of intelligence sinks rapidly .  in fact watching films like that after having watched  scary movie  is impossible keeping a serious face .  several times i tried to prevent myself from laughing  without succeeding .  and then i realized that practically the whole theatre was laughing .  its the same thing that has been told and told and told over and over again as if it was the revelation of the century .  how many times must we tolerate the same clich ? s that have haunted the slasher genre since its birth ?  it has been so many films about masked killers that most of us have developed an allergy for them .  they are the most stupid  meaningless  predictable and soulless films in existence .  however  director john ottman manages to make  urban legends : final cut  into one of the worst achievements of this godforsaken genre .  what was done with a sense of redemption for past failures and irony in  scream   ottman takes seriously .  for that reason alone  it is worth a look  just to realize how bad a movie can be .  its tough to find comparisons for such an achievement  and we have to dig in ancient history to find a movie that would match its intellect .  even movies like  lost in space  and  mission to mars  seem spectacular in its shadow .  we have not seen such waste of t !  ime and resources since  showgirls  ( 1995 ) .  no matter how hard i tried to find positive elements in this so called production  i came up with nothing  except the way the killer was dressed .  here i feel that i have to compliment the costume designers trysha bakker and marie-sylvie deveu  that have wisely replaced the well known scream-mask with a very elegant fencing mask .  jennifer morrison (  stir of echoes  ) is all right  and the other actors best achievement is keeping a straight face when pronouncing the words from the script .  in fact the only thing that is terrifying about this film ( with the exception of its screenplay ) is its portray of film schools .  if these graduates will be the directors of the future  then hollywoods golden days are over .  rumors are already spreading through the internet that columbia tristar is already developing a third installment .  lets just hope and pray that its just an urban legend .  , NEG  we are grateful that we have the songs of grace chan to comfort us .   starring lee kang-sheng  yang kuei-mei directed by tsai ming-liang written by tsai and yang ping-ying cinematography by liao peng-jung  taiwan  24/12/99 .  the millenium approaches .  an incessant downpour batters an unnamed city .  sectors of the city are being sealed  quarantined due to the onset of a mysterious virus .  the virus causes people to act like insects : they crawl about on all fours  hide from bright lights  huddle in damp corners .  the water supply to the quarantined zones will be cut off in a weeks time .  residents are advised to evacuate the area  asap .  this premise--kafka by way of cronenberg--is the background for the hole  which could have been a great movie  but  sadly  ends up as a waste of good ideas .  the quick sketch above suggests a dark  absurd  hallucinatory near-future parable of life in the late 20th century ; in execution  however  it is nothing like that .  the virus  the evacuation  the visual possiblities of the deluge : these are all relegated to the background .  instead  the hole focuses on the lives--for want of a better word--of a man ( lee kang-sheng ) and a woman ( yang kuei-mei ) who live in the same apartment building  and who have no personalities .  the entire movie taks place in settings that are uniformly ugly and sterile : the charmless rooms and corridors of a post-industrial apartment complex  photographed to look as dim and dingy as possible .  its a vivid setting  but an unappealing one  especially with the monotonous hiss of falling rain and the gurgle of drainage pipes in the background .  the man lives in the apartment directly above the womans .  one day  a repairman investigating a leak leaves a small hole in the floor of the mans living room  opening into the ceiling of the womans living room .  this hole--symbol of the solitary opening in the characters lonely  compartmented lives--allows them to interact in unusual ( and mostly non-verbal ) ways .  example : the man  suffering from the onset of the virus ( or so i assume--everything is obscure in this movie ) vomits through the hole .  the woman  wandering around in the dark  accidentally puts her hand on his vomit  and then cleans it up .  this is what passes for meaningful communication .  and they say romance is dead .  much of the film does not even focus on their interactions  such as they are .  there is almost no dialogue and we learn next to nothing about these people .  they are ciphers .  instead  we are treated to long takes in which we witness their miserable lives ; we watch  for instance  as the woman boils some water  pours it onto some noodles  then eats the noodles .   ( this is as fascinating as it sounds . )  offered as counterpoint--or perhaps relief--to these dreary sequences are a series of musical numbers  fantasies in which the woman lip-synchs to pop songs by grace chan ( popular  so im told  in 1950s china ) .  she prances around in grimy hallways and grungy stairwells  incronguously lit by cheerfully bright spotlights .  sometimes  in these fantasies  she is joined by the man .  these scenes are presumably intended to be bright and fanciful  sharply contrasting the dreariness of reality  but they fail .  when the man and the woman dance  it seems half-hearted and listless .  astaire and rogers this is not .  even in imagination  these people are numb  weary  boring .  the hole is part of the collection 2000 series  a group of films commissioned by french tv station la sept arte on the subject of the millenium .  others include canadas last night  brazils midnight  and american hal hartleys the book of life .  the book of life is the only other one that i have seen  and it is infinitely superior to the taiwanese entry .  witty  energetic  humane  it makes the the hole seem ( ahem ) empty .  american movies with nothing to say try to disguise their lack of content with flashy movements  quick cuts  superficial emotions .  foreign movies with nothing to say do what the hole does : they point the camera at something of minimal interest for unbelievably long periods of time  and call it art .  the hole is self-evidently a film about alienation  and perhaps director tsai ming-liang wants the audience to share in his characters alienation .  if so  he succeeds .  perhaps it is a challenge : he dares us to enjoy this movie  despite his best attempts to ensure that we dont .  if it was a challenge  i wasnt up for it .  , NEGwhat happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in real life ?  you get martin lawrence in a coma ( the comedian thought he was getting fat  so he put on numerous layers of heavy clothing and went jogging in 100 degree heat  ending up in a coma ) .  so what happens when you put martin lawrence in a fat suit in the movies ?  you get an audience in a coma .  in big mommas house  lawrence plays a fbi agent whos a master of disguises .  when a naughty  naughty man escapes from jail and seeks out his former girlfriend ( the very sexy nia long . . .  the only thing worth looking at in this movie )  she flees to georgia to stay with her rather large southern aunt  big momma  ( ella mitchell ) .  the fbi follows her in order to recover the large sum of money stolen in the bank robbery that sent the naughty man to jail .  however  big momma is called away on an emergency .  sensing that they could lose their only chance to capture the criminal  lawrence goes undercover as big momma .  and let the comedy begin !  big mommas house is the definition of a  gimmick  movie if there ever was one .  the plot can basically be summed up as  martin lawrence dresses up as a fat woman  . . .  and even that description is too wordy .  you can just see this script plotted out on a chalkboard with martin lawrence/fat woman in the middle of the board with a big circle around it

irresistible  attempts to be a whimsical romantic comedy but  more often than not  comes off as laughable  leaving you to wonder why rising star sarah michelle gellar ( t . v . s  buffy  the vampire slayer  ) would choose such an obviously inept film project to waste her time on .  things get off to a bad start right from the onset as amanda ( sarah michelle gellar )  a young woman who runs her late familys struggling new york restaurant  runs into a mystery man who forces a bushel of crabs on her and then vansihes into thin air .  while out shopping  she also meets tom ( sean patrick flanery )  a charming  handsome man  who happens to be planning a ritzy restaurant for the department store he works for  and later when he decides to drop by her dive  called southern cross  for lunch  she somehow makes a delicious crab dish for him  even though she is known to not be a very good chef .  suddenly  amanda finds her restaurant  on the edge of foreclosure  rejuvenate to life as customer begin to swarm for her food  which strangely causes everyone immediate jubilation when it hits their mouths .  are amanda and tom destined to be together ?  and is it not just because of the magical food  but because they really  truly like each other ?  and what exactly is going on with the food she is making ?  does it have anything to do with that pesky crab she got that sits on the shelf in the kitchen somehow assisting her in her food preparation ?    simply irresistible  is a ridiculous and just plain goofy romantic fantasy thats as flimsy as a slice of bologna .  it takes one joke---that people who eat the food are taken aback by it in most unusual ways---and recycles it over and over again until the film has reached an appropriate running time of 95 minutes .  add in a music montage every ten minutes ( these are actually the best scenes in the movie  which certainly tells you something about the film itself )  and what youve got is an utterly empty  if not necessarily boring  excursion .  the cast of  simply irresistible  is fairly good  but it is the supporting characters who are the most interesting .  patricia clarkson ( 1998s  high art   in which she played a drugged-out lesbian ) is a standout as toms colleague  and is thankfully given a few funny lines of dialogue .  also of note is larry gilliard jr .  as amandas cooking assistant and buddy  who is allowed to create a seemingly full character out of only a handful of scenes .  of the main stars  sarah michelle gellar is fine  but really does often look like shes struggling through the unmistakably clumsy material  and if sean patrick flanery plans on keeping a film career in the future  he has certainly got to pick better projects than this .  the bottom line is that  simply irresistible  is the exact opposite of its deprophesized title  and when the movie got to the point where the characters began to float in mid-air ( an unamusing plot device that was repeated in the stupid last scene )  my mind checked out from the characters and the romance .  when i think about it in hindsight  i should have checked out in the very first scene  where the point of the action was for gellar to crawl under tables looking for a runaway mechanical crab .  now  that certainly is what id call magical !  , NEGi wont even pretend that i have seen the other 3 alien films .  i saw glimpses of alien and aliens and fragments of alien 3  but i have by no means actually sat down and watched any of them .  so take my opinion from an unbiased and impartial perspective : alien resurrection is not worth the large bag of lollies i was munching into after a hard days work .  i didnt just dislike it so much because the plot was awful ; most of the acting was very average or the special effects got tiresome after 5 minutes of painful viewing  but also the fact that every tedious ingredient thrown in attempts to give this pointless dribble some meaning .  sigourney weaver  whos role in alien earned her an academy award nomination  plays the character of ripley   who died fighting against extraterrestrial scum in alien 3 . 200 years later  scientists use a sample of blood found at the site of her death to recreate ripley - including the alien that was stuck inside her .  in no time they remove the alien from her body and separate the two ; yet ripley is now not completely human  possessing strange amounts of strength and being able to withhold greater pain than a normal being .  im sure someone can explain exactly why this is so  but for now well just ignore it and move on .  why  you ask  would ripley and the alien inside her be recreated ?  well  the smart little lab researchers believed that they would be able to discover many advancements in science from studying the alien creature .  these were the same people who said they could control the alien and that their was no danger in their research .  they ( yawn ) were wrong .  it doesnt take a genius to figure out that the rest of the film is a continuous cat and mouse chase between the humans who die off one by one and the aliens who open their mouths on every possible occasion to show off their frightfully scary un-flossed teeth .  theres a little saying that goes something like this : if youre going to make a bad film  do it well .   i have seen plenty of disappointing and underachieving movies  but they are not the ones that really bother me .  alien resurrection  a good example of a film that really gets up my nose  is not so much a discouraging experience but an off putting one .  there is no way to describe why the australian ma rating was given to this film other than unnecessary and repulsive gore  which attempts to distract us from the wandering-but-not-going-anywhere plot .  in one scene my stomach churned as i witnessed a mawkish looking alien put its hand on a characters head and literally ripped most of his face off .  another one featured ripley sticking a knife through her hand just to impress someone she was talking to .  fair enough if it were in a horror film or even if it bared any significance to the story  but this is unfortunately not the case  and this sort of bizarre gore is inexcusable .  if you think im struggling to find one good aspect about the film  then you thought right .  one exciting scene is a credit ( and the only part remotely worth seeing ) to the film  in which an alien chases two men ( one a cripple ) up a tall ladder with interesting results .  but of course after that thrilling scene alien resurrection had no problem in returning to its pathetically low standard  and ends up crashing into the shores of movie dullness more often than japanese kamikaze jet fighters fall off their skis .  so in a film where the one liners come as bad as earth man  what a shit hole and the primary means for one mans strategic attack is to bounce bullets off walls to hit an opponent  its no wonder why alien : resurrection turned out to be as off putting and clumsy as it is .  oh  and in case youre wondering about my bag of lollies  the less i enjoy a film  the more i eat .  so all the lollies were gone in 15 minutes ; but however empty the bag turned out to be  it was still a long way ahead of the movie  , NEGsynopsis : lifelong friends rafe ( affleck ) and danny ( hartnett ) join the us air force and are stationed at pearl harbor  hawaii .  rafe goes to england to fight alongside british pilots and is seemingly killed in action .  danny falls in love with rafes girlfriend  evelyn ( beckinsale )  but rafe survives and returns to confront his former friend .  meanwhile  the japanese sneak attack is imminent . . .  review :  pearl harbor  is a perfect example of movies as product rather than as art .  it is little more than a crassly-calculated attempt to woo the masses  enticing them with big stars  big effects  and a big setting -- but no heart .  it is difficult to criticise the actors  because they do everything the movie demands of them .  sadly  this amounts to barely more than reciting dialogue of such sheer banality that it makes one eager to see the script randall wallace wrote with his right hand at the same time as he was writing  pearl harbor  with his left .  the plot here is pure cliche  and the wartime setting simply a convenient backdrop .  there is no genuine exploration of what pearl harbor meant to the united states  and no insight into its vital role in inciting that country to join world war ii .  instead  there is just an assembly-line love triangle  some empty patriotic rhetoric  and a laughable attempt to placate japanese viewers via the inclusion of some reticent imperial commanders ( when one intones   i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant   i nearly fell out of my seat ) .  to the movies credit  it does include a fantastic portrayal of the attack itself  an exciting and dizzying hour which plunges viewers into the war .  if only the remaining two hours had been crafted with such skill  perhaps this memorial day non-event would have been worth watching .  , NEGthis is a film that i was inclined to like at the outset : the two main characters had been involved with the fine television drama st .  elsewhere for several years  and i had understood that the director/screenwriter had written for the show on occasion also .  i am sorry to report that the results were not up to my expectations  nor were they satisfactory .  if i had to list a reason why . . . .  but that would be getting ahead of myself ; besides  its not immediately clear  as there are so many problems with the film .  adam arkin plays a grade-school teacher who is sardonic  cynical  and somewhat abrasive  but a good teacher .  he spends his lunches playing basketball by himself on a nearby court .  one day  he meets a drifter ( david morse  who plays jack morrison on st .  elsewhere ) in the park  and inveigles him in a game of one-on-one basketball .  morse turns out to be good  and a friendship slowly develops between the two  as their respective professions progress on the screen--arkins teaching  and morses selling of paper flowers to passing motorists .  so far  my major complaint would be the lack of dialogue  and the constant intrusion of the musical soundtrack .  good music to be sure  but it doesnt replace the dialogue for setting the mood or telling the story--it makes the film somewhat minimalistic  a technique i rarely admire .  suddenly their friendship is interrupted by morses introduction to a fellow teacher of arkins  a woman arkin has long admired from afar  but it too reticent to approach .  it appears that she begins to admire morse ( who enjoys here attentions  but isnt sure what to do about it--she doesnt realize that he is a drifter  and knows nothing about his past )  and this causes friction between arkin and almost everyone else .  until then  i had only a vague dissatisfaction with the film .  the conclusion is where it begins to evolve into a full-fledged failure .  the woman  at least to me  appeared to be fairly shallow ; i didnt realize how shallow until her final scene with arkin  where she reveals that she has been trying to make arkin jealous by her attentions to morse .  somehow  this is made to appear as if it is arkins fault  and it is left with him feeling somehow victorious that hes gotten such a find of girlfriend .  frankly  dropping her on the spot would have seemed the most civilized action arkin could make ; punching her in the mouth not the least .  after this  the childish confrontation between morse and arkin at the end seems almost natural .  if i had to summarize a major gripe  its that this is a story spread too thin  that creates semi-likable characters at the outset  and then suddenly jerks them into being 16-year-olds at the last moment .  it might be true-to-life with some people ; but that doesnt mean * i * have to like it .  i dont .   .  avoid .  , NEGi love movies .  i really do .  every time i watch great movies like goodfellas ( 1990 ) or raiders of the lost ark ( 1981 )  a tear comes to my eye due to the awesome talent  skill and entertainment that is on display .  even lower grade films such as the naked gun 33 1/3 ( 1994 ) or ghostbusters ii ( 1988 ) while not exactly brilliantly well made  are certainly not a waste of celluloid and present entertainment value .  then theres my favourite martian  the exact opposite of what a movie should be : a hurried  poorly written and acted movie with one goal  to make money .  disney  ever since the lion king ( 1994 ) have lost their magic touch  but this dross just shows how far disney have sunk .  christopher lloyd plays a martian who crash lands in front of t . v reporters tim ohara car ( daniels )  and soon tim finds the martian in his home  trying to recover and fix his spaceship .  along with his zoot spacesuit  voiced by wayne knight  must fix his spaceship before it explodes  and also try to stop his identity being revealed to the public  firstly by ohara  but later by rival t . v presenter brace channing ( hurley )  by calling himself tims uncle martin .   laughter is supposed to arise from the comical events  but never does .  many bad films have good intentions  but my favourite martian doesnt appear to try to provide any entertainment .  filled to the brim with wham bang special effects  my favourite martian offers little more than some nice eye candy .  christopher lloyd mugs his way through the entire movie  ive never seen a man pull a face for 93 minutes until now .  jeff daniels plays staple nice guy and his role is useless .  his performance is incredibly lazy  although his paperthin character doesnt deserve more than the performance he gives .  darryl hannah looks as pretty as ever  but her role is somewhat  erm  limited .  hurley mistakes acting for shouting and looking like a twit and wins the david wilcock award for most irritating  godawful performance in a moving picture .   way to go liz !  for the supporting cast  disney manage to assemble every character actor out there  during the film i was going he was the guy in . . . ah . . er . . .   before finally giving up and switching off .  another major setback is the staple comedy sidekick .   unfortunately  the writers ( sherri stoner and deanna oliver  if anyone cares ) forget that a comedy sidekick needs to be funny .   instead  they deliver zoot  the martians deeply unfunny sidekick .  although meant to be a manic character no doubt  every line that comes out of his neck is a dud .  a real dud .  citizen kane delivers more laughs a minute than his hell spawn piece of polyester .  even the kids in the audience were insulted by this character : not one child even bothered to smirk .  its a nice special effect  though .  another problems with this comedy are the gags themselves .  or rather  the lack of them .  my favourite martian reaches a new level of toilet humour : it goes past the bowl  down the pipe and into the sewer .  now  toilet humour can be funny  as dumb and dumber ( 1994 ) humorously showed .  but here  characters farting  belching and almost getting crapped on ( literally ) is not amusing .   its insulting .  theres one good gag right before the credits  but it appears the guy who wrote that gag tragically died and his unfunny twin continued .  either that  or they were hoping that easy to please six year olds wouldnt mind the fact that his movie is beaten by men at work in the funny stakes .  yes  men at work .  yowza !  the fact that a lot of money was pumped into this film  and that they actually got people to agree to be in this film just depresses me even more .  there are thousands of brilliant films out there that cant get distribution  yet trash like this gets released nation-wide with ease .  thankfully  as soon as it makes its money  it will never be seen again  and my favourite martian will end up where the two lead characters do near the end of the movie : down the toilet .  , NEGi looked at the  internet movie database  s awards section for this film  and found that this was nominated for a golden globe for  best picture ( drama ) .   anyone whos seen this film can back me up on this : this is the worst of the  great  disaster films  and thats not really saying a lot for this film .    earthquake  is basically notable because it originally included some theatre thing where the theatre shook when the big earthquake occured .  on video  its a bland and slow-moving film which gives us a bunch of different characters ( the disaster film requisite )  then brings them together in the struggle against the big disaster .  while this worked in  say   the towering inferno   it doesnt here for one single reason : we dont care about any of the characters .  the film gives us charlton heston ( in one of many crap 70s films he made  including  skyjacked  and that classic   soylent green  ) as a rich man married to ava gardner  who is having a little affair with a young single mom ( genieveve bujold ) ; a renegade police officer on suspension ( george kennedy  in his least humored performance ) ; in the second weirdest subplot  a motorcycle stuntman ( richard roundtree  right after his  shaft  thing ) whose big stunt is he goes on a little track that goes upside down ( yea  snore ) ; and the weirdest subplot : a military man/bag boy at a grocery store who has a little thing for buxom victoria principal  and eventually gets vengeance on those guys who made fun of his hair ( ! ! ! ) .  in smaller subplots  theres a pointless bit about people who are flying over l . a . ( the city in the film  by the way )  one whos playing cards and married to a boring non-acting husband ( you think this one can go nowhere ?  guess again . he gets interested in the final frames ) ; theres genieveve bujolds moron son  who has a little adventure with wires ; and for some much-needed comedy  theres walter matthau ( billed as walter mutha . . . .  - the only laugh in the film )  as a wild drunkard  whos big moment is a dance he does at a critical time .  as for the actual  earthquake   its rather a let-down .  theres a full hour of character-setups  none of which is interesting  then about 10 minutes of shaking  crumbling  and a bit where a house almost falls on bujold ( narrowly missing ) .  this film needed that whole theatre-shaking : they needed to wake everybody up because they were so bored .  theres little suspense following the quake  although this film tries for it .  theres an adventure in a crumbling high-rise office building  the wires with the kid  and the movement of people who are all injured .  but none of these are all-too suspenseful .  the finale with the heston/gardner/bujold love triangle is ended in a basic flip-of-the-coin bit  which brings out a big let-down .  and theres no real finale .  even  volcano  ended nicely  and that movie really sucked .  not only is it hokey  but you dont care about any character .  who cares if heston dies ?  who cares if he choses bujold or gardner ( although i would have chosen gardner  mainly on the basis that she can actually act ) ?  who cares if richard roundtree makes money on his stupid  stunt ?   who cares if that idiot kid falls to his death on some wires ?  and who cares about that whole plane spiel ?  if anything   earthquake  is worth a viewing for the same reason  glen or glenda ?   is .  i mean  i laughed at this more than i did at  bio dome .   but thats another story ( and review ) .  in short   earthquake  gives disaster pics a bad name .  , NEGthe formula is simple .  trap a varied group of people on an isolated location  then pop in a seemingly unstoppable monster to kill them one by one .  these have been the successful ingredients for many good films ( the thing  alien  aliens  and tremors to name a few ) .  so  why is it that so many films following this recipe end up pathetically bad ?   ( see the relic for a particularly putrid example . )  perhaps it is simply too easy to forget the necessary binding ingredient : effort and ideas .  deep rising meets these two requirements part way  but not enough to salvage the film .  treat williams is finnegan  the leader of a small boat crew who hire out their services ( and their boat ) for any activity . . . no  questions asked .  this time  however  they may have gone too far .  their passengers  led by the ominous wes studi  are the type of multi-national terrorist squads usually only seen in die hard films .  and their cargo . . . lets  just say it has very high explosive potential .  what is the target of these thieves ?  why  the argonauticus  of course  a high tech luxury cruise yacht on its maiden voyage .  but something else is hunting the argonauticus . . . something  ancient and deadly .  by the time the thieves arrive  nearly everyone on board the ship has been killed .  and now the creature senses fresh meat !  so  you have the thieves and their mercenary boat crew  joining forces with the surviving passengers ( including the ship owner canton ( anthony heald )  and a thief with less lofty goals  trillian ( famke janssen ) ) against the terror from the deep .  and the monster gets to pick them off one by one .  fortunately for the creature  this particular band of criminals happens to be the dumbest the world can offer .  why else would they indulge in petty squabbling while they watch their friends become fish food .  if theres a more clarion call for unity  i dont know what it might be .  its pretty easy to guess who will get killed off when .  there are no surprises in that the most interesting characters seem to last until the end .  for the most part  the watery tentacles seem to be acting on the audiences impulses to get rid of the most boring characters first .   ( although i wonder if the filmmakers might have extended djimon hounsous life a bit if they knew this would be released so soon after his acclaim for amistad . )  treat williams is a passable hero  and famke janssen does her best julia roberts impersonation .  but while wes studi and anthony heald are particularly slimy  very little of the rest of the company stand out in any way .  the biggest treat in the film  however  has to be pantucci  kevin j . oconnors whining engine-boy  under finnegans employ .  his constant quips may be a bit over-written  but they manage to capture the same vein of nerve-addled humor that bill paxton delivered as hudson in aliens ( or todd graff as hippie in the abyss  for that matter ) .  its just a stock part ( the comic-relief character )  but it almost makes this tired alien clone bearable .  as far as the monster goes  although the cgi is done well  the creature has no logical consistency .  think back to the great ( or even just good ) movie monsters .  they all had a set of  rules  about what they could do  and how and why they would do it .  part of the joy of those films was slowly discovering  along with the heroes  just what those rules are .  the tentacle monster in deep rising doesnt have a set of rules . . .  or if it does  not a very good one .  it merely eats ( or drinks  as the case may be )  and there is no rhyme or reason for what it does in order to do so .  the film never explains why the argonauticus is attacked in the first place .  it simply happens .  the action scenes are decent  but few are noteworthy .  the film definitely does suffer from its proximity to titanic .  deep risings peril in the water scenes pale next to camerons ( but can you really blame them ) .  unfortunately  deep risings efforts are more on par with speed 2 .  on the plus side  however  the films closing image shows some promise for a potentially interesting ( but unlikely ) sequel .  perhaps youd be better off waiting for that one .  , NEGthe thirteenth floor is a bland  obligatory exercise in genre film-making .  if i hadnt recently watched the matrix and open your eyes -- both of which are similar but far superior -- i might have been a little nicer to this picture .  craig bierko makes an adequate hero as douglas hall  the rich co-creator of a perfect human world simulation who is suddenly blamed for the murder of his boss ( armin mueller-stahl ) .  everything that was subtle and smart about the previously mentioned films is battered over our heads in this one  and characters stare at each other for maddeningly-long periods of time and refuse to communicate on any realistic level .  the acting is okay  but the film suffers from every logical flaw one could think of  and features a script ( co-penned by director josef rusnak ) loaded with cliches and stock characters .  there are individual scenes and ideas that work -- i like the thought of a sentient computer program -- but none of the films strengths are recognized to any meaningful degree .  producer roland emmerich  based on this and his previous directorial efforts  seems hell-bent on bringing us the ultimate standard in mediocre science-fiction .  , NEGmy giant begins with a monologue thats more funny than not and a distinctive `princess bride   medieval fairy-tale-in-the- ? 90s feel .  i was pleasantly surprised how sharp the comedy was  with very funny scenes occurring on a movie set in romania where talent agent sammy ( billy crystal ) is visiting a client and in the monastery where sammy ends up after being mysteriously saved when he accidentally plunges his car into a stream .  and when sammy meets max  his giant  mysterious savior played by gheorghe muresan  there is magic in the air ; albeit it a bit goofy  i loved every minute of it .  the film  of course  plays on the size difference between the two  and at times you would almost swear it must be special effects .  i particularly enjoyed a shot of sammy dangling his legs from a max-sized chair as the two face each over an enormous table and eat from oversized bowls and spoons .  i also liked jere burns ( from tvs `something so right ) performance as the director of the film in romania .  at this point  the primary flaw in the film is that gheorghe muresan is incredibly hard to understand  particularly during his fast-paced first scene .  it is unfortunate that the script required him to speak quickly right out of the gate  as i did understand him more as the film continued and i became accustomed to his speech .  however  about the time muresan becomes coherent  the characters head to new york and the film takes a dive .  off the high board .  suddenly  we are expected to believe sammy is a do-whatever-it-takes slime ball .  up until this point he was pursuing his own interests to be sure  but he didnt come off as a desperate jerk .  if he had  the first scenes could never have been so lighthearted and magical .  but now  in new york  we are further introduced to his neglected wife and son  and his character is desperate enough to involve max in a disturbing giant vs . midgets wrestling match  which i found quite unpleasant and jarring within the framework of the film .  indeed  many scenes stuck out of this film like incorrectly placed puzzle pieces .  this includes the scenes featuring steven seagal  when sammy gets max a role in a big  hollywood movie filming in las vegas .  while i enjoyed seeing seagal poke fun at himself  the scenes appeared to exist solely because of his participation  rather than because the film demanded it .  and the audience is required to take a huge leap to believe that max would win the role based on his quotations of shakespeare .  at this point i found myself thinking  `were supposed to believe that someone would cast this guy in a film ?   then i realized he was  and i was watching it .  in the final third  the film undergoes another transformation  this time to unbridled sentimentality .  note : major plot points are revealed in this and the final paragraph .  max went to america because sammy promised to reunited him with his childhood love  lillianna  who hasnt seen him since he was a normal-sized kid .  her refusal to see max ( unbeknownst to him ) leads us to an awkward `ends justify the means scene as sammys wife serena  played nicely by kathleen quinlan  poses as lillianna .  i found this scene offensive .  not only did it rely on deception to induce warm  fuzzy feelings from the audience  it reduced max to someone we should pity and coddle  which i thought was quite undeserved .  i think max could have handled the truth  gratuitous illness and all .  late in the film we learn max  and in fact all giants  have a heart condition which shortens their lives considerably .  this could be an enlightening revelation  but the film seemingly presents it only to justify sammys transformation into a caring  sensitive guy -- and hey  a great dad and husband  too !  `my giant suffers from a poorly constructed story line and undeveloped characters whose actions are determined by plot points rather than their own internal persuasions .  a stronger story with more room for character growth might have been possible if the focus was on maxs struggle to be accepted and cast in movies instead of sammys struggles to get money and become a better person .  in this scenario  maxs illness could have been a integral part of the film not a story motivator .  sentiment and emotion would have followed naturally .  instead  were apparently not supposed to like sammy until the end  but were not allowed to focus on max .  crystal and muresan give adequate and at times enjoyable performances  but in the end  `my giant left me feeling like id been fed gruel from a giant spoon .  , NEGalexandre dumas meets hong kong action with newcomer justin chambers reprising the oft-played character of dashing swordsman dartagnon in director peter hyams adventure  the musketeer .   for some reason that i may figure out later  i dont know why the time  money and effort were put into the making of  the musketeer .   it may be that someone had the clever idea of combining the dumas characters and story with the current enamor with the action work of hong kong imports like this films xin-xin xiong (  once upon a time in china  ) and yuen woo-ping from  crouching tiger  hidden dragon .   the result is a mix of genres that dont mesh well .  elements of the ritz brothers-style comedy ( for those few who remember that comedic troupe from the 1939  the three musketeers  )  the man with no name from  a fistful of dollars  ( dartagnan demands that the bad guys apologize to his horse in a direct ref to the clint eastwood spaghetti western ) and hong kong action choreography are all utilized in the original script by gene quintano .  the result is an action flick that bears little resemblance to its source material while it makes contemporary that material in an effort to grab the  matrix  crowd .  alexandre dumas may well be rolling in his grave if he knows what was done to his classic oeuvre and characters .  the real problem with the  the musketeer  lies in the casting of the two lead  romantically intertwined characters  dartagnan and francesca ( mena suvari ) .  chambers has the boyishly handsome good looks for the character  a la chris odonnell  but lacks any onscreen charisma .  suvari has the doe-eyed  pretty looks as the chambermaid who has the ear of the queen  but she  too  does not have the chemistry to command the screen .  if  the musketeer  makes them any money  they should invest in acting lessons .  stronger performers may have helped to raise the bar on this one .  the supporting cast is  on the surface  impressive .  catherine denueve plays the queen of france and lends her character an air of royalty  dignity and humor  especially when she plays off of dartagnans mentor  planchet ( jean-pierre castaldi  who reminds of andre the giant in  the princess bride ) .  stephen rea looks good in the part of the conniving usurper cardinal richelieu  but is given very little to help flesh out his character .  tim roth is the kind of bad guy you love to hate as the cardinals chief henchman  febre .  he is so bad he makes simon legree look like a boy scout .  the rest of the players  particularly the three musketeers aramis ( nick moran   lock  stock and two smoking barrels  )  porthos ( steve spiers ) and athos ( jan gregor kremp )  are background fodder whose role is to come to dartagnans aid when needed .  peter hyams does double duty as director and cinematography and may be too stretched to do both well .  a stronger hand at the helm could have helped the mediocre performances of the leads and better utilized his veteran thesps .  photography is straightforward action fare that goes through all the appropriate action flick motions - dartagnan takes on a tavern full of thugs and bests them single-handed ; he fights a gang of febres henchmen aboard a speeding coach to protect the queen ( with the obligatory branches hanging over the road ) ; he goes one on one with his lifelong enemy  febre  who murdered dartagnans folks years before .  it is all routine stuff .  the renowned wire work developed by the hong kong action masters is used to artificial effect as the players leap  defying gravity  up walls and from horse to horse .  it works in a sci-fi film like  the matrix  or in a classical fantasy like  crouching tiger  hidden dragon  but just calls attention to itself in  the musketeer .   at one point i could swear i saw the stunt wire being used .  it did not make me a believer and i am very disappointed .  with a run time of 106 minutes it should have been more like 80 and i give it a d .  , NEGi think maybe its time for the batman series to be put to rest .  not only has the first two films unsettling insight into what it would really take for someone to make himself into a  superhero  been abandoned  but this one throws any lingering realism out the window and goes for all-out camp with few traces of the self-mocking restraint of the relatively light-hearted third installment .  let me give you an example : in the first scene of the movie  batman ( george clooney ) and robin ( chris odonnell ) are summoned to a museum that has been literally turned to ice by mr . freeze ( arnold schwarzenegger ) in an attempt to steal a diamond .  mr . freezes thugs are armed with none other than hockey sticks  but this is no problem for our heroes : automatic skates shoot out of their shoes  at which point robin manages to get hold of a hockey stick  grabs the diamond  and stick-handles it through the museum .  i might have expected this from an airplane-style farce  but i dont think thats what this movie is supposed to be .  after all  the previous three batman movies were actually fairly realistic by the standards of the superhero/action genre and kept the corny death-defying stunts to a minimum  while playing the obligatory cheesiness with at least some amount of irony .  not any more ; the list goes on and on in this one .  robin holds onto the outside of a flying rocket ship 30  000 feet high in the atmosphere  climbing in the door to save batman .  mr . freeze and poison ivy ( uma thurman ) leap from a skyscraper and survive by landing in a small pond .  a world dominating mad scientist lives in a fortress that seems to have been stolen from the old he-man cartoons .  my very favorite example is the scene in which batgirl ( alicia silverstone ) gets in a race with motorcycle thugs  during which they come up with the clever notion of dousing the road with gasoline and setting it on fire to distract her .  not bad  but wouldnt the police ( or maybe batman ? )  notice if the road was on fire ?  i knew gotham city was this crazy anarchic place  but .   .   .   .  it also seems that the creators of the batman movies are obeying some unwritten rule that there have to be more main characters and plot lines in each successive installment .  as if three protagonists and two villains werent enough  batman and robin further weighs itself down with an underdeveloped side story of the failing health of bruce waynes butler alfred ( michael gough )  which might have seemed poignant if it wasnt surrounded by so much silliness  as well as several scenes with elle macpherson as bruces girlfriend which serve no purpose other than to remind us that she is in the movie .  all this might be semi-excusable if the story were interesting and entertaining  but it isnt .  in fact  its kind of boring .  mr . freeze and poison ivy pale in comparison as villains to past baddies such as jack nicholsons joker and danny devitos penguin .  their evil plot is as predictable ( schwarzenegger actually pronounces the words   today gotham city  tomorrow the world !  )  as it is lame-brained ( didnt it ever occur to poison ivy that freezing the entire world would kill her precious plants too ? ) .  and robins constant challenging of batman mostly just makes him look bull-headed and stupid and makes us wonder why batman ever would have taken him on as a partner in the first place .  strip away the stars  the fancy set design  and the status as a  batman movie   and all you have here is another barely passable summer action flick .  , NEGin my opinion  a movie reviewers most important task is to offer an explanation for his opinion .  but with soul survivors  im so full of critical rage that this review is liable to turn into a venomous  uncontrollable rant  obligations damned .  however  protocol forces me to do otherwise .  soul survivors tells the story of four college-bound friends : cassandra ( melissa sagemiller ) is sweet and innocent .  party girl annabel ( eliza dushku of bring it on ) is dating world-weary harvard student matt ( wes bentley ) .  matt still has feelings for cassie  who is now dating sean ( casey affleck ) .  driving back from a creepy  gothic party  the quartet gets into a horrific car crash .  sean dies  leaving cassie crestfallen and guilty  made worse because sean saw matt kiss cassie just minutes after sean revealed his love for her .  as cassie mopes through her classes  she sees the ghost of sean all over the place  urging her to follow him .  along with being plagued by other ghastly visions  cassie is also followed by thugs from that strange party .  annabel and matt try calming her down  but no one shares casss visions .  she has to figure out this purgatory all by herself .  rarely have i seen a director so thoroughly mishandle material .  in his directorial debut  steve carpenter does nothing to provoke the audience into feeling any emotion .  when the movies camerawork isnt pedestrian  its clich ? d .  carpenters need for close-ups  his camera following sagemiller from behind  drain the movie of any anticipation .  we already know what to look for  so why should we be surprised ?  and the sense of scary atmosphere  which was recently done so well in the others  is nowhere to be found here .  carpenters script relies on random twists and turns with a minimum of logic and loads of laziness .  this is a movie where the ending features one character providing an explanation about the plot to another character  which is one of the lamest screenwriting devices around .  the second lamest device  of course  is the   oh  it was all a dream  resolution .  and guess what ?  this movie has both !  not that the main body of the film  which has sagemiller constantly running in fear or having a nervous breakdown  is anything worthwhile .  since theres no captivating dialogue  no character chemistry exists anywhere .  thats a huge problem  since the four main characters are supposed to be couples .  carpenter cant even get the smutty scenes right  which are becoming more prevalent in pg-13 movies like bring it on and get over it .  [the film was recently re-cut from an r rating to get more kids in the seats .  -ed . ]  when sagemiller and dushku dance together at a club  he rarely shows them in a full shot and he never keeps the camera on them for longer than a second before relating to some michael bay-style quick cuts .  and when sagemiller and dushku take a shower together after getting covered in paint  theyre fully clothed .  regardless  any sexiness in that scene is undercut by its stupidity .  why wouldnt they wash the clothes in the sink or in the washing machine ?  why would they shower in their clothes ?  what if they werent covered in latex paint ?  the cast  which will see better material in the future  would be wise to leave this one off their resumes .  i felt sorry for affleck  who ive liked in other movies  and bentley  who was great in american beauty .  dushku  who possesses an alluring femme fetale quality  has got to stop taking roles belonging to rose mcgowan .  as for sagemiller ( star of the aforementioned get over it )  i want to see her in a movie where she plays a person  and not an object for gawking .  and im not even getting into luke wilsons role as a priest .  at least hes friends with wes anderson .  bottom line : soul survivors is so awful i feel compelled to knock on doors and warn people about it .  , NEGreading the cast and director for the new mobster comedy   analyze this   i asked myself   how could this miss ?   robert de niro (  taxi driver    raging bull  )  billy crystal (  city slickers  )  lisa kudrow (  the opposite of sex  )  and director harold ramis (  national lampoons vacation  ) .  these are usually reliable filmmakers ( well  okay  crystal has been in a sizable slump lately )  and tellingly  the first half-hour of  analyze this  was very funny .  unfortunately  as the running time ticked away  i began to think that the first thirty minutes had  unbeknownst to me  been rewound and were being replayed another two-and-a-half times .  the film has obtained a clever premise  but does not have any idea what to do with it as it progressively becomes more and more repetitive until i finally stopped enjoying or caring about what was happening on the screen .  middle-aged psychoanalyst ben sobels ( billy crystal ) life is finally going very well .  although he has never gotten along with his own uncaring parents  especially his father  who is also a psychiatrist  ben has an easy-going teenage son ( kyle sabihy ) and is about to travel down to miami to get married to his tv news reporter girlfriend  laura ( lisa kudrow ) .  in little but a flash  however  ben suddenly sees his plans ruined when he accidentally hits the car of the mob and subsequently gets paid a visit from famed mafia guy paul vitti ( robert de niro )  who desperately wants counseling  even though he himself wont even admit to having anxiety attacks .  ben tries to help paul  mostly so he will get him off his back  but the plot gets more complicated when paul follows ben to his wedding  which ends with a man dropping eight stories to his death .  it seems to ben that no matter what he does  paul vitti will not go away  and the more they become involved  the more bens potentially happy life gets into danger .    analyze this  has a few laughs sprinkled throughout ( mostly in the first half )  but i always had the nagging thought that what director ramis and writers peter tolan  ramis  and kenneth lonergan had done was thought of one joke ( robert de niro lightly spoofing his serious past mafia roles  while terrorizing and becoming buddies with comic billy crystal ) and then tiresomely recycled it for the duration of the 106-minute running time .  admittedly  de niro is very funny here ( and i cant remember the last time you could use that adjective to describe him )  and crystal is in top-form  but the whole movie is weighed down directly on their shoulders with nothing else to support them  including a substantial plotline .  since  analyze this  bills not one  not two  but three writers  youd think that they would have been able to work together to fix the noticably large flaws  but they must have all been on auto-pilot .  one of the most disappointing and wasted opportunities in the film is the way the movie deals with the supporting characters  all of which have next to nothing to do and arent even given multi-dimensional characters to attempt to develop .  coming off of her oscar-caliber work in two of last years best films   clockwatchers  and  the opposite of sex   lisa kudrows throwaway  girlfriend  role is an incredible step down .  sure  kudrows fellow  friend  jennifer aniston did the same thing two weeks ago in  office space   but at least we got to spend a little time with aniston .  kudrow  meanwhile  mostly just stands around  no doubt wondering why she agreed to appear in this film in the first place .  chazz palminteri  as rival gangster primo  fares even worse  in a role that plays more like an afterthought than an actual character .  finally  molly shannon ( rising film star and cast member on  saturday night live  ) has a rousingly hilarious one-scene cameo right at the beginning as one of crystals patients and then completely disappears .  too bad  considering that the supporting actors surely have proven that they have the abilities to support de niro and crystal .  once  analyze this  approached its second wedding scene leaving kudrows laura standing alone at the altar once again  i had become thoroughly annoyed by where the story had gone  and had mostly lost respect for the character we were supposed to sympathize with the most  ben .  afterwards  the climactic scene with ben posing as a fellow mob boss in place of the depressed paul  became a real laugh-free dead-zone  losing its last remaining comic punches .    analyze this  proves that talent can certainly help any film out  but when the written material isnt up to their level  what we are virtually left with is a vacuum of thin air .  , NEGas we see the terrible events that unfold before our eyes in the middle east at the moment  hollywood doesnt loose the oppertunity to get involved  by telling stories and expressing opinions .  this film centers on a relationship forged throughout the adult lifetimes of two marine colonels  hays hodges ( tommy lee jones ) and terry childers ( samuel l . jackson ) .  they fought side by side in vietnam  where childers saved hodges life by shooting an unarmed pow .  thats against the rules of war but understandable  in this story anyway  under the specific circumstances .  certainly hodges is not complaining .  years pass .  hodges  whose wounds make him unfit for action  gets a law degree and becomes a marine lawyer .  childers  is now a respected and much-decorated hero that has served his country with his life and sould .  because of his excellent record  childers is sent to yemen to rescue the american ambassador ( ben kingsley )  cowering in the embassy under assault from violent demonstrators and snipers blasting from rooftops .  childers does what he has to do : evacuate the family and protect the men under his command .  after three marines die and the colonel thinks he sees ground fire  he orders his troops to shoot into the firing crowd .  more than 80 yemeni men  women  and children are mowed down .  childers is immediately accused of ordering his men to fire on a crowd and murder of unarmed civilians .  he persuades his old friend hodges to represent him in the courtroom drama that occupies the second half of the film .  did childers violate authorized u . s . military rules of engagement ?  or are there simply no rules in war ?  the answers to these stereotypical questions are obvious  but the inconsistent plot immediately raises all sorts of other questions .  the murder of 83  innocent civilians  has to result into something greater than a simple trial in the u . s . where is the accusations from the arab leaders ?  where is the u . n . ?  the film ends without even telling the most interesting story : what happens on the international arena ?  this film ( in a way akin to films such as  a few good men  ) has already been accused of breaking the rules of morality and ethics and even of racism .  these accusations are pretty heavy  but also unfair .  what director william friedklin truly broke was the rules of decent filmmaking .  one of the earliest apparent problems with rules of engagement is its lack of credibility .  the entire operation in yemen may remind us about what happens in the middle east right now  but is overdone  contrived and unrealistic - as if a chain of events had to happen in a particular manner in order for the plot to proceed .  a lot of it is so cheesy that no one could possibly accept it as reality .  that is precisely why its not offensive .  it is completely unobjective .  many stories are started and never finished .  many questions are asked  but never answered .  a lot of parallels are referring to nothing .  it seems that neither the director  producers or the screenwriter can make up their minds about the contents of their film .  is it about arab mentality ?  americas foreign policies ?  americas role in the world ?  corruption in the higher circles ?  it goes on and on .  it consists of countless stories  but not a definable plot .  it tries to be everything for everyone and ends up being nothing for no one .  i think that it is ironic  because director william friedkins probably most acclaimed film was  the exorcist  which had a silly story  but became a rather effective film .  in this case you have a strong story with many possibilities and the result is a silly film .  though several scenes bare the mark of professionalism ( such as the impressive battle scenes )  his latest film does simply not engage .  i believe that friedklin is a director that is absolutely depended on great scripts and talented producers in order to succeed .  its obvious that he has neither and the result is therefore a catastrophe .  the characters feel designed  unreal  merely shadows  with no life outside the conflict .  even the actors can not save this film from going under .  though both jackson and jones act admirably  with performances that are as good as you get with a script like this  it is not something that these great actors can boast of .  they have roles that they could play blindfolded with their hand on the back .  jackson is gray and jones uninteresting .  the rest of the cast  including ben kingsly  blair underwood and guy pearce are simply waiting for their paychecks .  the time has come for the verdict .  on the charges of complete lack of objectivity  i find this film guilty .  on the charges of breaking the rules of reasonable filmmaking  i find it guilty .  but on the charges of racism i find this film not guilty  because of its inconclusive and often silly plot that lacks objectivity everywhere  not only when concerning the arab population .  i must admit that the film is dangerously near the line of being racially offensive and i do think that screenwriter stephen gaghan went a bit too far  portraying the yemeni people almost as stereotypical hollywood bad-guys .  this is very sad  since in a time like this it is crucial to not lose objectivity and proclaim the truth .  however  it is absolutely necessary to remember that the muslim terrorists are responsible for most of the terrorist activity in and outside the united states .  and that its not a coincidence that u . s . residents in the middle east  including yemen are on constant maximum alert .  , NEGfrom dusk till dawn ( director/editor : robert rodriguez ;

hated it .  on its menu for fun  is a violent feast served up as charm and done in a tongue-and-cheek manner .  its a serial killer/horror film farce of nonstop over-the-top action and sleaze  involving decapitations  vampires  biker fights  extended gun play  and an array of gore that has to be seen to be believed .  a film that regales in its vulgarity and campiness for blood-and-gore  as it goes out of its way to gloss over the clich ? s of the conventional b-films .  its geared only for the cult film crowd  and will make its mark there one way or the other .  the plot involves two psychopath brothers  the older professional bank robber and killer seth gecko ( clooney ) and the perverted psychopath killer  richie ( tarantino )  who kills for pleasure and is also a rapist .  they escape jail and go on a killing spree in wichita and then flee to a liquor store in a small texas border town .  they have just robbed a bank and killed a number of cops  they have also taken a middle-aged bank teller as a hostage .  in the liquor store they kill a texas ranger and the store clerk  and burn down the store .  stopping off in a flop-house motel  richie rapes and slaughters the hostage .  these scenes are all done with an eye for comedy and parody  if thats possible .  on the tv news  it says they have killed 16 so far and most are texas rangers .  the brothers plan to get to mexico and meet carlos ( cheech )  who will give them a place of sanctuary for thirty percent of their illegal take .  with road blocks and car searches at the border  the brothers commandeer a motor home of a vacationing family who stopped at their motel so that the father could sleep in a real bed .  there is the father  jacob fuller ( keitel )  who just resigned as a minister because he lost faith ever since his wife died in a car accident ; his sexy 20-year-old  innocent daughter  kate ( lewis ) ; and  her shy brother scott ( liu ) .  its not explained how he happens to be chinese .  the story really becomes bizarre when they get across the border and get ready to meet carlos in a bar/whorehouse for truckers and bikers called the titty twister .  the place is open from dawn to dusk  thus the films title .  heres where rodriguez has a chance to throw convention out the window and have some absurd fun  as the place turns out to be a vampire hangout .  it sells sex to its patrons  and has exotic stripper santanico pandemonium ( hayek ) do her alluring strip before turning into a vampire .  the brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out of the place  as the vampires keep coming and the killings become the films staple .  this supposedly clever script did nothing but turn me off  though there were a few funny moments in a film that was dripping with special effects and spent most of its script in finding novel ways to showcase its killings .  ill take a pass on this one  its just not my style of a film .  the characters were as empty as the story  and the film was an easy one to forget .  , NEGplot : a little boy born in east germany ( named hansel ) loves the american music .  one day  he gets the opportunity to meet and marry an american g

another confused boy  who soon turns into a star .  that boy also turns his back on hedwig  and it isnt long before hedwig puts together his/her own band and tours the states via seafood restaurants .  this is the story of his/her life  told via flashbacks and musical numbers .  critique : an artsy-fartsy musical with great songs and a superb performance by john cameron mitchell  doesnt really come together as a whole  with over-the-top symbolism  incoherence and too much pretension to retain my interest all the whole way through .  in fact  this isnt so much of a realistic  articulate  behind-the-scenes look at the rise of a rock n roll star  as it is an ambiguous  overly poetic and incomprehensible struggle of a man  his sexuality and his identity as a whole person on this planet .  i guess that i was expecting the former going in .  the film is somewhat interesting to a point  but i was personally never able to involve myself too much  as the basic symbolic and incongruent nature of the film left me feeling cold and distant .  but it is definitely tuned to a certain type of audience .  chances are that if you are a fan of the wall  the rocky horror picture show or even priscilla  queen of the desert  the elements tangled in this movie will likely strike your fancy ( some of the characters in this film even ask the audience to sing along at some point  and provide the lyrics of their song  on-screen ) .  well  i personally dont care for those films  and didnt really get into the whole  show  atmosphere of this movie either .  i guess i mightve looked at it all too literally  but like i said earlier  i just didnt care enough about the characters to delve into the  so the butterfly represents his freedom ?   side of things .  all i know is that the film left me with many questions unanswered and didnt make me feel any more fulfilled .  what was hedwigs relationship with that other member of his band ( with the beard ) ?  what happened with hedwig and tommy gnosis at the end of the movie ?   ( was that an actual sequence or a fantasy ? )  what ever happened to the lawsuit ?  and more . . .  all of which were part of the film and interested me somewhat .  if the only idea behind the film was for the main character to uncover his/her sexuality  then thats one thing  but as many of the relationships and situations presented themselves in this movie  i wanted some resolution to those pieces as well .  i didnt get it .  the films humor also didnt tickle my funny bone either .  then again  ive seen many a film in these art-house theatres in which patrons are rolling down the aisles with laughter  while all i see is a tiny bit of whimsy on the screen .  some of these films are also better enjoyed with the added  atmosphere  of a plant called marijuana  and i can certainly see how this movie ingrains within itself some nifty visual elements  in order to jazz up that experience .  but being sober as i was and expecting a coherent  funny  musical with a transsexual twist  i didnt leave the theater very satisfied .  i came out having watched an existential story of a confused man caught up in a musical lifestyle  wrapped in metaphors  dramatics and more questions than answers .  i will  on the other hand  definitely hand some props out to the lead in this film  john cameron mitchell  who is also the man who wrote  directed and created the play on which this movie is based  and the tunes  which will likely be enjoyed by anyone who digs the sex pistols  david bowie and the whole 70s glam-rock scene .  note : btw  it seems as though pretty much every single  mainstream  critic in the united states loved this movie from top to bottom ( and thought that it was really funny to boot ! )  so you might want to take that into consideration yourself .  but having said that  the main reason that i started this dinky website in the first place was because films like this would sometimes be uniformly applauded by the  official  critics  while i  a regular  joblo  in the audience  just wouldnt get what all the fuss was about .  this movie is a perfect example of why i continue to write movie reviews .  wheres joblo coming from ?  moulin rouge ( 8/10 ) - grease ( 8/10 ) - everyone says i love you ( 5/10 ) - the opposite of sex ( 8/10 ) - dancer in the dark ( 5/10 ) - o brother  where art thou ( 7/10 ) - loves labours lost ( 8/10 )  , NEG8mm is not going to enlighten your day .  its a dark  grimy and disturbing portrait of underworld snuff films and filled with excessive violence .  not only do you need the stomach to make it through this bloated mess  youll require a lot of patience as well .  nicolas cage seems to be doing quite a bit of overacting as of late .  he wore a bizarre get-up and did a lot of yelling in the terminally awful snake eyes  and here he attempts a performance that can relate to someone completely losing their grip on reality .  cage plays private investigator tom welles  praised for his secrecy and reliability .  at home  welles is a family man  with a wife ( catherine keener ) and a small daughter to take care of .  his new assignment is a bizarre one : the wife of a formally deceased millionaire has hired him to solve a mystery regarding a film found in her husbands safe .  the film appears to be some kind of cheap pornography involving a teenage girl and a masked man  until the girl is brutally murdered .  or so it seems .  welles  of course  begins to burrow deeper and deeper to uncover the truth .  and the more he becomes involved in this disturbing case  the more he gets in over his head .  he hires an adult book store clerk named max california ( joaquin phoenix ) to be his guide through the ugly underworld of pornography .  max knows what welles is getting himself into  and explains  `you dance with the devil  the devil dont change .  the devil changes you .   these turn out to be very wise words .  8mm has a premise that begs for a better execution .  the set-up is slick and well played  as cage uncovers the identity of the girl and travels to hollywood to locate her .  this is where everything goes awry .  although director joel schumacher succeeds in frightening us with his grotesque portrait of the `real world  he forgot to inject any interest or excitement to the formula .  everything about the movie becomes dull and lifeless  repelling the viewer like the effect of bug spray to insects .  although it had enormous potential  the third act of 8mm is a total bust  leaving intrigued audiences in a baffling state of extreme disappointment as the proceedings spiral out of control .  cage is the films sole flame of energy .  his performance is actually believable  but soon the directors demands start to weigh heavily on his shoulder and he begins stumbling along in desperation .  still  youve got to give him credit for holding this project together as long as he did  for that is no easy feat when you consider the problems at hand .  welles trail soon leads him to a bizarre filmmaker ( played convincingly by peter stormare ) who is notorious for the hardest-hitting snuff films in the industry .  this is where cage goes over the edge into a serial killer-like phase  in which he must take revenge on all those who murdered the innocent girl in the film .  he tracks down the masked man responsible for the killing ( chris bauer )  and they have a bloody brawl in the local cemetery  a fight sequence that would look more at home in a schwarzenegger movie .  written by andrew kevin walker  8mm dissipates into a poor mans seven  with all the violence but little of the effectiveness that made the latter such a chilling masterpiece .  furthermore  what has become of joel schumacher ?  the director has recently experienced a major drought  slumming in the depths of dismal flop after flop ( batman and robin  anyone ? ) .  this putrid thriller is certainly not going to revive his career  so perhaps schumacher should start exploring his lighter side .  , NEGsynopsis : original  jurassic park  survivor alan grant ( neill ) is tricked by paul and amanda kirby ( macy and leoni ) into leading an expedition to an island overrun by dinosaur  to rescue their stranded son .  grants team is picked off one by one as they encounter dinosaurs both new and familiar  and grant grows to realise that some breeds are more intelligent than he previously thought .  review : there is one reason why  jurassic park iii  is better than its immediate predecessor   the lost world : jurassic park  .  the latter wasted 129 minutes of my life ; the former  only 94 .  the first  park  was a marvellous film  full of awe-inspiring sights  interesting characters  and genuine thrills .  its two successors have been pale imitations  amounting to hundred-million-dollar b-grade horror movies .  at least this third entry realises it ; whereas  the lost world  tried to justify its existence with a ludicrous and overextended plot   jurassic park iii  simply sticks its characters on an island with a bunch of dinosaurs and lets the mayhem begin .  there is a desperate sense of deja vu presiding over this movie ; the computer-animated dinos are no longer novel or exciting  and even the first-time presence of aerial lizards scarcely improves the situation .  remember that wondrous first trolley ride through the park in the original movie ?  nothing in this rehash even comes close .  add in execrable dialogue from screenwriters buchman  payne and taylor  and phoned-in performances by the normally capable macy and leoni  and it is difficult to recommend the film to anyone but dino enthusiasts .  at least neill makes some effort to retain the dignity of his character  and there is much less gore than in  the lost world   making this installment more suitable for children .  , NEGthe characters in jonathan lynns  the whole nine yards   yet another in an endless recent string of mob comedies ( 1999s  analyze this  and  mickey blue eyes   2000s  gun shy  )  are rarely ever written as real people  but merely as one-dimensional caricatures .  when an added layer to one of their personalities is revealed  it is not to service the character development  or to naturally offer up instinctive characterizations  but to accommodate the convoluted plot .  in a lightweight comedy  you might say  it is not required to have perfectly realized figures  just as long as they get the job done .  unfortunately  for a comedy to work  it has to at least succeed at being funny  and if there was a laugh-o-meter available  id guess that it briefly ascended around 2 . 5% of the time for me .  suffice to say  the comedy in  the whole nine yards  works about as well as the broken-down lawnmower in my backyard  and when a giggle surprisingly arises every twenty to thirty minutes  it is by sheer luck .  nicholas  oz  oseransky ( matthew perry ) is an amateur dentist living in the quiet suburbs of quebec .  trapped in a hateful marriage with the conniving sophie ( rosanna arquette  delightfully hamming it up with a clearly artificial french-canadian accent )  one day oz sees that someone is moving into the house next-door .  walking over to greet him  he is horrified to discover it is jimmy  the tulip  tudeski ( bruce willis )  a former contract killer for the mafia who has just been released from prison .  once getting to know him and becoming his friend  oz is more comfortable with his identity  but for sophie  it means a possible hitman to do away with oz .  in her scheme  sophie sends oz to chicago to cash in by informing his old mob boss ( kevin pollak ) about jimmys whereabouts  but in the process  he falls in love with jimmys wife  cynthia ( natasha henstridge )  who is being held hostage .  upon return to quebec  and with one contrivance after the next  ozs dental assistant  jill ( amanda peet )  is overjoyed to discover that he lives beside  the tulip   and forces him to set up a meeting  since jills dream in life turns out being a contract killer herself .  have you got all that ?  because there is more .  much  much more .  and this is a movie that  without credits  is little over 90 minutes and feels only like an hour .    the whole nine yards  is an ultimately unsatisfying and empty-headed excursion into well-worn terrain already set by far superior pictures .  how the cast  most of which are respectable actors  got caught up in such a cliched  deficient film remains a mystery  unless they thought it might aspire to match the congenial screwball zaniness of director lynns 1985 comedy classic   clue : the movie .   going into the theater  preliminary comparisons between the two movies were unavoidable  but by the twenty-minute mark  when i had chuckled once and laughed nary a single time  it was clear this production was in serious trouble .  since the entire running time depends on the mechanisms of the plot  and the screenplay  inauspiciously written by mitchell kapner  collapses with every failing  comedy  bit  the film is an inevitable dead zone in the way of substance and  frequently  entertainment value .    the whole nine yards  is neither facetious nor  aside from the subplot about jills shocking eagerness to become a professional hitwoman  inventive  and more often than not  just lies there  the film spinning drearily around and around in the projector  but never igniting any sort of spark .  a few select actors do what they can with the material  while others make no impact at all .  on the mediocre side are actually those playing the two central characters : matthew perry and bruce willis .  perry  innocuously enjoyable on tvs  friends   plays the same exact sitcom-style character in all of his movies ( from 1997s  fools rush in  to 1999s  three to tango  )  and it has become a crushing bore .  meanwhile  willis makes next to no impression  and because of the limited guise of his jimmy  the tulip  tudeski  oftentimes disappears into the background .  their three female counterparts fare noticeably better .  best of all is natasha henstridge  far more radiant than in the exploitative  species  movies  who adds unanticipated depth and emotion to cynthia .  henstridge has the talent  for sure  to break out of these countless throwaway roles  but first she must fire her agent .  amanda peet has a lot of fun as the quirkily straightforward and giddy jill  and seems to know more about the art of comedic payoff than even perry who  thus far  has strived on a career based solely on comedy .  it is too bad  then  that peet is unnecessarily asked to disrobe in a climactic scene  with the obvious sole purpose being to show off her breasts .  finally  rosanna arquette is awful as sophie  but something tells me that was her purpose  and her clear overacting only aids in brightening up her limited screen time .  also popping up is michael clarke duncan  fresh off an oscar nomination for his role in  the green mile   as jimmys largely built friend and fellow killer  frankie figs .  when  the whole nine yards  eventually sputters to its underwhelming conclusion  one is left pondering how such a film ever got greenlit .  a great deal of movies of this type have been made in the past  and this one is nothing but a duplication of better films  so what was the point ?  without a passable screenplay or any notable technical accomplishments   the whole nine yards  rests solely on the presumed charm of the cast  and half of the actors are not charming at all .  now  what does that tell you ?  , NEGtake two old and dying men  a lifetime of regrets  a house full of sins  a thoroughly despicable man  enough lies  insecurities and other character defects to keep a team of psychiatrists

find herself struggling with his impending death .  having married for money  she discovers that she has actually fallen in love with the old guy and regrets having cheated and lied .  earl regrets having cheated on his first wife and estranging himself from his only son ( tom cruise  eyes wide shut )  now a misogynist self-help guru who teaches men how to  seduce and destroy   his sexual and vulgar perspective on male/female relationships is so over-the-top as to be utterly unbelievable .  meanwhile  jimmy gator ( philip baker hall  the insider ) is also dying of cancer .  not as physically incapacitated as earl  jimmy is still able to perform his duties as the lovable host of a long-running quiz show which pits adults against children .  the current whiz-quiz-kid is stanley spector ( jeremy blackman in his film debut ) who is tired of the pressure of performing and is willing to call it quits .  on the other hand  quiz kid donnie smith ( william macy  mystery men ) would like nothing more than to return to the spotlight when he was a  somebody .   his pathetic life is souring as he can no longer capitalize on his brief 15 minutes of fame which stanley is all too eager to relinquish .  jimmy has his own family crisis as his drug-addict daughter ( melora walters  boogie nights ) refuses to have anything to do with him for reasons which are not disclosed to us until the end of the film .  grabbing at one last attempt at happiness she reaches out to a softhearted cop ( john c . reilly  never been kissed ) even as she tries to push herself away from him because she deems herself not worthy of his affection .  this dysfunctional group carries on for what seems to be an interminable two-thirds of the movie .  and then it gets worse  literally raining frogs .  yes  frogs .  assuming it to be an intended deus-ex-machina device  it is an ineffective one because it doesnt seem to faze the characters much .  oh  they may step gingerly around the splattered frog corpses littering the streets  but otherwise  the frog shower didnt seem to change their behavior or pattern of living ( or dying ) .  there is simply too much going on in this movie and most of it is distasteful to watch .  mr . anderson further obscures the film by incorporating a loud and intrusive sound track that often drowned out the dialogue  a character who apparently rapped a significant clue to a plot development which was completely unintelligble  and a heavy handed segment of  historical  occurances containing ironic twists which set up absolutely nothing .  one of the recurring themes is found in a line donnie quotes :  we may be done with the past  but the past is not done with us .   this is an absolute lie .  god is in the forgiveness business .  in fact  as we humbly ask for forgiveness and repent or change our offending mindset  gods word says that he not only forgives  he also forgets .    i  even i  am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake  and will not remember thy sins .   isaiah 43 : 25 [kjv]  the spiritual one who keeps bringing up our unrighteous past is the same one who wants to keep us in a state of condemnation .  dont let him .  next time your spiritual adversary reminds you of your past  take great pleasure in reminding him of his future .  he hates that .  , NEGso much for sweet returns .  after smart horror films were starting to be made again after the exploitative 80s slasher movies  starting with 1996s  scream   and followed by  scream 2    urban legend   and the original   i know what you did last summer   a film like   i still know what you did last summer   was bound to be made sooner or late .  it is a perfect example of the exact reason why horror films temporarily burned out  and that is because they reached for the lowest-common-denominator in filmmaking  favoring non-stop deaths and gore for suspense  and trading in fleshed out  likable characters for one-dimensional nitwits .  it has been exactly one year since julie james ( jennifer love hewitt ) suffered through the ordeal of being terrorized by ben willis  a psychopathic fisherman whom her friends and she accidentally hit in the middle of the road  and then  thinking he was dead  dumped him into the ocean .  since then  julie has relocated to boston university  and although often paranoid and haunted by bad dreams  she has been able to put her life back together .  when julies friend  karla ( brandy )  is called up by a radio station and answers correctly what the capital of brazil is  she wins a vacation to the bahamas for four people  which also includes karlas horny boyfriend  tyrell ( mekhi phifer )  and will ( matthew settle )  who karla sets julie up with after her own boyfriend  ray ( freddie prinze jr .  also returning from the original )  doesnt show up .  when they reach the secluded island  they discover it is the last day of the open season  and will be stranded there for the 4th of july weekend with a few employees to fend off a violent storm headed for them .  of course  julie  her friends  and the workers arent the only ones there  as the murderous ben willis  dressed in fisherman garb  returns to seek revenge on julie once and for all .  it is a sad state of affairs when a movie like   i still know what you did last summer   is made .  i am a very big fan of horror movies  and so it is especially disheartening to find out that this sequel to  ikwydls   which i am a fan of  is almost an exact replica of a  friday the 13th  movie .  while the original focused more on the story and characters  as well as genuinely suspenseful moments  thanks to the screenplay by kevin williamson ( who didnt return to write the sequel  and it shows )   i still know . . .   has no story to speak of  and is so vacuous of ideas  that the filmmakers  were forced to have a murder occur every five minutes just to keep the audience interested .  also gone are any signs of character development  and since every single character died before i got to know them  all i was left with was to stare at the screen  indifferent to what was going on .  while i cared about the fates of the characters in the original  it made no difference to me in this sequel who lived and died .  they were all paper-thin and pointless  except to become victims to the lethal hook of the fisherman .  another element that made the original so memorable were some superbly crafted set-pieces  like the store sequence with sarah michelle gellar  but there are none to speak of in this sequel ( although they do come close at one moment with brandy ) .  since so many people were killed every couple minutes  the suspense and scares evaporated faster than salt in water .  also of note is the mystery of the second killer  and accomplice to ben  but it is obvious from the first frame who it is  and so i couldnt even have fun at that  like i did in the  scream  movies and   urban legend .   it figures that just as slasher films were starting to get some recognition again  a film would come along and ruin it for everyone else .  maybe the people who made   i still know what you did last summer   should have realized that in order to make a good movie  you must have a screenplay---or at least one that isnt such a black hole for thoughts and ideas .  the ending of the film inevitably leaves the door wide open for a third part  but judging from this amazingly lackluster first sequel  everyone involved should have quit while they were still ahead .  , NEGaround the end of 1998  a japanese cartoon came to the usa television  and really wasnt that big .  in fact not many people even knew what pokemon was  but in 1999 it hit big with kids and adults alike  and became one of the biggest franchises and merchandise seller of all time .  in fact it even spawned a big screen adventure pokemon : the first movie which for what it was  wasnt all that bad .  it grossed $31 million in its opening weekend  and went on to make almost $90 million .  fans thought it was great and now is a second movie in the pokemon craze   pokemon : the movie 2000  which is far inferior to the original animated movie .  first up is the plot  which there really isnt much of  in fact the plot what there is : a bad guy trying to destroy the ancient never before seen pokemon  lugia  is about it  except the fact that ash kethcum the worlds best pokemon trainer must try and stop him before he destroys this one pokemon forever .  well there you go  of course ash is followed by his friends misty  brock  gary and his pokemon friends  pikachu  squirtle  charizard  the usual .  even though the first movie wasnt a great film  it was definately an enjoyable well-made movie with an actual thin storyline .  this new movie however is nothing but garbage  there is nothing good to it storywise  and its only good thing comes from some plush animation and colors .  compared to the first film  this movie is awfully bland  from its opening titles  to the end titles it tries its best to work  but fails miserably at every corner .  the characters are 1-dimensional  the story thin as chicken broth  and the writing very lame .  even the so called action scenes are extremely lame  and falls before it even gets a chance to go .  the voices even arent that good and almost feels like the stars dont want to be there  like they can tell that this is an extremel bad movie .  which it certainly is .  the film has one thing going for it and that is the animation  although not up to disney standards  it is still very good with some interesting cgis and very colorful animation  the colors jump out at you very fast  and seem very nicely put on film .  why a film this bad got such a good treatment with its animation is still a question to be answered  hopefully pokemon 3 next year will be much better than this trash .  for now watch the first one .  its much much better .  , NEGits a stupid little movie that trys to be clever and sophisticated  yet trys a bit too hard .  with the voices of woody allen  gene hackman  jennifer lopez  sylvester stallone  and sharon stone  this computer-animated yak-fest ( think toy story [1996] filled with used merchandising ) is one for the ant-eaters .  the main story is the independence of a worker named z ( allen ) .  he wants more to life than just digging away underground for the colony .  when he finds out about ``insectopia   a mythical place where all insects can run free  z  along with his colonys princess ( stone )  journey out into the world to find a meaning for life .  about 15 minutes into the picture  i began to wonder what the point of the film was .  halfway through  i still didnt have an answer .  by the end credits  i just gave up and ran out .  antz is a mindless mess of poor writing and even poorer voice-overs .  allen is nonchalant  while i would have guessed  if i hadnt seen her in the mighty and basic instinct  stone cant act  even in a cartoon .  this film is one for the bugs : unfunny and extremely dull .  hey  a bugs life may have a good time doing antz in .  , NEGgodzilla is a nuclear freak .  he is a lizard that has been mutated over the years and has become a new species  one that has a foot as long as this bus  and a claw as long as this sign .  this aquatic creature made its first attack in the pacific islands .  he tore up a ship that carried dozens of japanese men .  one survived .  only he was left to recount the terror that he had seen .  he was merely able to repeat the words  godzilla . . . godzilla . . . godzilla  .  the film then introduces us to matthew broderick  a biologist who has been studying the fascinating growth of chernobyl earthworms .    theyre 17% larger than they used to be !  he proclaims .  the u . s . military pulls him off this three year project and assigns him to figure out what godzilla is .  and  boy  does he find out .  and  boy  does godzilla suck .  i hate to use such a word in a review  something that is supposed to inform my audience  but i really need to drive this one home and i refuse to use explitives .  it is unbelieveable to me how the producers of this movie saw the final cut and said   ok !  its great !  lets show this puppy .   roland emmerich needs a good horse whipping .  his latest piece of trash makes id4 look like a masterpiece of modern american cinema .  and if steven spielberg had never made the jurassic park films  emmerich and his team of talent-challenged imbeciles would never have had a clue as to how the creature should look .  let me give you a few examples of this terrible attempt at filmmaking .  i plan on giving some things away here .  belive me  godzilla holds no surprises for anyone with an iq higher than their shoe size  so . . . no  worries .  however  if you are looking for that  first time thrill  and you refuse to let me do you this favor  by all means  stop reading now .  a . ) godzilla makes his first ever attack in the pacific islands .  he next strikes in new york city .  um . . . anyone have a map handy ?  b . ) the mayor of new york city is a heavy set individual with parted gray hair and thick glasses .  his name is mayor ebert .  his assistant is named gene .  gene gives ebert a thumbs down at the end of the film .  i couldnt make this up if i tried  folks .  c . ) stay with me on this one . . .  ok .  godzilla can out run torpedoes .  hank azaria can out run godzilla babies .   ( which look more like jurassic park raptors than the jurassic park raptors . )  d . ) the u . s . military  upon realization that godzilla has disappeared after running rampant through the city  decides that he  might be hiding in a building .   e . ) ( oh yeah  i can go all the way to e . ) godzilla strikes at manhattan .  manhattan  an island approximately the size of san francisco holds three million people .  they evactuate to new jersey in about one day .  no problem .  f . ) early on  they bait godzilla with fish .   ( he likes fish  you know . )  the thing is on an island .  the atlantic ocean is three steps east  but pile a whole bunch of grouper on fifth and 57th . . . oh  hes gonna come running .  g . ) you know what ?  ill stop with the list now . . . the  alphabet isnt big enough anyway .  the dialogue makes me wonder if producer dean devlin had his five year old do a re-write .    the kid is good !  he must have said .  maria pitillo is looking to become a name in hollywood by starring in this potential blockbuster .  bad move  maria .  acting doesnt get much worse than her turn as brodericks ex-flame .  matthew broderick is a good actor  but youd never give him a chance if godzilla were the only film of his youd seen .  jean reno needs to pick his american films a bit more carefully .  at times  godzilla seems to be headed toward a zucker  abrahams  zucker film .   ( airplane !  naked gun . )  the jokes are indeed that bad .  but just when you think the filmmakers are having fun with you  they take themselves seriously .  how dare they !  godzilla would have been better if it had only thrown in visual sight gags and fart jokes .  at least then we would know we were supposed to laugh .  each and every character in godzilla is beyond stupid and i was really pulling for the beast to kill more of them .  emmerich did do one thing  though .   ( and ive no idea if it was intentional . )  he made me sympathize with godzilla .  his attackers were so damn dumb that i felt sorry for him being pelted with bullets and missles .  but what made me feel even sorrier for him was that his famous name will always be attatched to one of the worst films hollywood has ever produced .  , NEGafter the recent animated debacles of   a rugrats movie   and  a bugs life   i am seriously considering raising my highly negative rating on dreamworks other insect film from october   antz .   i hated that movie  and yet  it is so much better than these latest two excursions .    a bugs life   is the second animated insect film in the last two months  and i hoped for the best  considering it was done in the wonderful style of pixars last film  1995s  toy story   but in no way does   a bugs life   even remotely match up to that .  flik ( david foley )  an ant  who along with his many comrades  has the job every year of gathering up the seasonal harvest  only to have to give half of it away to the dominating grasshoppers  led by hopper ( kevin spacey ) .  flik  however  feels all alone and unwanted in the world  especially after he accidentally loses all of their food  and the ants are threated by hopper to gather up a whole other seasons load by the time the last summer leaf falls from the trees .  banished from ant island  flik leaves the colony in search of some strong reinforcement to help out  but through a misunderstanding  returns with a handful of helpless circus bugs  including a walking stick ( david hyde pierce )  a dung beetle ( brad garrett )  a gypsy moth ( madeline kahn )  a male ladybug ( denis leary )  and a caterpillar ( joe ranft ) .    a bugs life   has one thing going for it .  only one thing .  with its glorious  bright colors  the computer-generated animation is a spectacle to look at .  the film itself  unfortunately  is a lifeless  unamusing contraption without any of the flair or excitement of   toy story .   the characters in   a bugs life   are an assortment of either unlikable or dull insects without any charm or personality  other than to stand around and recite arbitrary and thoroughly unfunny one-liners .  the thin story was also stretched out to a nearly unbearable 94 minutes  and it often felt as if they ran out of ideas throughout  and so they made up pointless scenes to pass as time-filler .  after giving such scathing reviews to the animated films from this year  i was beginning to think that i had simply outgrown them  but then i realized this is just not so .  i still adore almost all of the older disney films  and many of the newer ones  such as 1989s   the little mermaid   1991s   beauty and the beast   1993s   the nightmare before christmas   and yes  1995s   toy story .   maybe this has just been a bad year for childrens films  and hopefully  the upcoming   the prince of egypt   will not be a disappointment .  as for   a bugs life   i did not enjoy anything about it .  not the story  not the characters  and not even the voiceover work  which was far more lively in   antz .     a bugs life   goes down as yet another failure for disney  and it is a sad state of affairs when their best film in the last two years has been the minor jonathan taylor thomas picture   ill be home for christmas .   , NEGonce upon a time jean-claude van damme was a decent action hero .  the muscles from brussels bursted into the hollywood market with mindless adventure films  boasting his spectacular martial-arts ability .  some of these excursions were fun .  but now it seems like watching a van damme movie has become a painful chore  with no rewards but the virtually guaranteed helping of mind-numbing action .  and when the action goes sour  what is there left to enjoy ?  ill explain .  knock off is about a pair of counterfeit jeans salesmen working out of an office in hong kong .  marcus ray ( van damme )  a babe-magnet and stylish dresser  heads up the company with an annoying weasel of a partner ( rob schneider ) .  they become part of a plot involving microbombs implanted in counterfeit jeans  seemingly by a mole in the business .  im going to reveal about everything in the next paragraph  so if you want a review devoid of spoilers  skip onto the next one .  im not quite sure who gives a crap  but ill issue a warning anyhow .  tommy is really working with the cia .  his boss ( a very hammy and flat paul sorvino ) is the mole  and he wants to cause carnage with these tiny but immensely powerful super weapons .  he even stoops so low to put them into childrens toys .  if you thought this plot outline sounded intriguing  then you probably will enjoy knock off .  if you think that this ridiculous set-up couldnt even fill five minutes of screen time without causing you to roll over laughing  this might not be your cup of tea .  knock off sucks .  it stoops to ridiculous levels that most individuals could only conjure up in horrific nightmares .  it amazes me how far these producers will go to sell something  simply because van damme is the star .  the plot is pathetic garbage strung together by inane action sequences that will baffle your mind  the performances are so wooden you could use them to row a canoe  and the action itself is an absolute catastrophe .  director tsui hark ( who teamed with van damme in the superior  but still lame-brained double team ) is at the helm  and he would rather attempt to dazzle us with fantastic camera angles than engage us with the plot .  i suppose i enjoyed some of the camera work  but the incessant desperation of it all made me rather nauseous .  the picture freezes in the middle of an action sequence  speeds are altered consistently  and the camera tricks mostly apply to traveling up gun barrels as the weapons are fired .  it all sounds very cool .  trust me  it isnt .  as much as it scars me to say this ( har  har )  van damme is terrible .  sure  he does lots of fancy kickboxing moves and dodges giant crates with the greatest of ease .  he looks like hes doing a bad impersonation of jackie chan  and his performance is stiff and tired .  i hate to say it  but perhaps its time for mr . van damme to give up his day job .  its really a test of endurance watching knock off .  i suppose theres some enjoyment derived from schneiders character  who is extremely annoying  but provides the films better moments .  and what is the beautiful lela rochon doing in this movie ?  hopefully she grabbed her paycheck and then fled the premises like an olympic sprinter .  knock off doesnt even stand strong as a mindless but entertaining action film  like a handful of van dammes others .  no  this movie is an embarrassment to the entire action genre of modern filmmaking .  and considering how low hollywood has stooped as of late in that department  that is certainly not saying much .  note to self : avoid universal soldier 2 : the return upon release in august ? 99 .  , NEGthe year is barely a week old  and there is already a candidate for the worst of 1997--the relic  a would-be chiller thats more successful at making the audience laugh than scream .  in this ridiculous film from uberhack peter hyams ( whose last two pictures were dreadful jean-claude van damme vehicles )  a creature that feeds on the hypothalamuses ( hypothalamii ? ) of humans and animals goes on a killing spree in a chicago museum .  how did this creature come into existence  and why does it feed on hormones ?  the  scientific  explanation cooked up by the four--yes  four--credited screenwriters ( amy holden jones  john raffo  rick jaffa  and amanda silver ) takes  suspension of disbelief  to new heights  even by monster movie standards .  but as cockamamie as the science is in the film  it isnt quite as hard to swallow as the casting of the clueless penelope ann miller as a brilliant molecular biologist who specializes in evolutionary genetics .  miller acts as if she wants an oscar nomination  turning every scene that requires the slightest display of emotion into an overblown oscar clip  complete with piercing wails and glycerine tears .  give it up  penelope--its a _monster_movie_ .  on the flip side  tom sizemore just phones in his performance as a police lieutenant  but his role is so thankless that its hard to imagine it being played any more effectively .  its quite funny to see a film indulge  with the straightest of faces  in all those cheesy horror movie cliches that wes craven lampooned so well ( and so recently ) in scream .  for example  in one early scene  a museum security guard goes into a bathroom stall late at night .  ok  we all know whats coming  but as if we didnt need any more confirmation  he pulls out a joint and starts puffing away .  everyone knows what happens to people who do drugs in a scary movie .  and later  miller frantically runs out of a museum exhibit after she hears some suspicious heavy breathing .  does she make a beeline for the front door ?  of course not--she runs into the ladies room and cowers in a stall .  with all the cliches  it is only fitting the films climax offers what is perhaps the most overused one in recent film : that of someone outrunning a fireball .  if the relic is truly  the next evolution in terror  as the poster states  then the horror film--and humanity--is in even worse shape than we thought .  , NEGsusan grangers review of  two can play that game  ( screen gems )  since the success of  waiting to exhale   there have been several romantic comedies about african-american professionals .  this female revenge fantasy  vivica a . fox plays shante smith  a stunning ad exec who seems to have reached the pinnacle of success : a mansion  a sporty car and an idyllic relationship with a hunky  hot-shot lawyer  morris chestnut .  shes at a point in her life when she dispenses advice to her grateful girl-friends ( monique  wendy racquel robinson  tamala jones ) .    when your man messes up  no matter how small it is   she smugly decrees   yuh gots to punish him .   so when she catches her hot man dancing at a bar with a smart and sexy rival  gabrielle union  she devises her own version of  the rules   a 10-day  tough love  emotionally punishing plan to get him back .  unfortunately  writer/director mark brown (  how to be a player  ) breaks the cardinal rule of romantic comedy : you have to like the protagonist - and shrill  self-congratulatory shante smith is a smirking  superficial  spiteful shrew who doesnt realize that rational rules cannot always be applied to love .  having her talk directly into the camera gets stale very quickly and the  day one    day two  title-card device underscores the tedium .  comic anthony anderson scores as chestnuts boisterous best-friend  and singer bobby brown does a cameo as a scuzzy mechanic whos given a smooth makeover by ms . robinson .  but the out-takes over the closing credits contain more humor than the film itself .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10   two can play that game  is smarmy if slick 4  filled with misogynistic attitude and blatant product placements ( coca-cola  miller genuine draft ) but little else .  in this r-rated ( for explicit sexual language )  pseudo-hip battle of the sexes  the audience loses .  , NEGsusan grangers review of  glitter  ( 20th century-fox )  theres less here than meets the eye .  or  put it this way  if you thought madonna was awful in  shanghai surprise   mariah careys worse in this reworking of  a star is born .   she plays billie frank who  despite being abandoned by her singer/alcoholic mother ( valerie pettiford )  believes shes destined for greatness because everyone tells her she is .    youve got this amazing gift  and you gotta use it   her roommate says .    your voice - its incredible   says another singer .    i aint never met anyone like you   proclaims julian  dice  black ( max beesley )  the hot new york dj who becomes her svengali-like producer/lover .  problem is : her signature song   i didnt mean to turn you on  is wretched .  and when she fumes out of filming her first music video because the director wants to  exploit  her by having her wear a bikini  the audience bursts into laughter .  exploit mariah carey  who chooses to wear as little as the law will allow ?  come on !  writer kate laniers script is fatuous and director vondie curtis-hall doesnt have a clue how to handle the glitzy pop diva and  as a result of their incompetence  whispery-voiced ms . carey seems to be embarrassed on-screen .  she almost cringes when the camera comes in for a close-up  pursing her lips and averting her glassy eyes .  talented british musician max beesley appears equally inept  and as cinematographer geoffrey simpson pans around the manhattan skyline  theres an audible audience groan when the twin towers of the world trade center come into view .  perhaps one of the reasons ms . carey suffered her highly-publicized nervous breakdown this summer is because she saw a preview of this clunker .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10   glitter  is a pathetic 1 .  right now  its tops on my list of the worst of 2001 .  , NEGthe ads make  hanging up  seem like an upbeat comedy about a rascally father and his three daughters .  anyone who went to the movie expecting that left disappointed .  all of the movies funny scenes were included in the ad .  so what do we get ?  eve marks ( meg ryan ) just put her father lou mozell ( walter matthau ) into a hospital .  once upon a time  lou was a hollywood screenwriter who collaborated with his now-estranged wife .  his one great moment in life was writing a film for john wayne  who gave him a giant bullet-shaped trophy .  now lou is senile and deteriorating rapidly .  eve tries to convince her sisters georgia ( diane keaton ) and maddy ( lisa kudrow ) that their father is dying and needs them .  both are slow to show concern .  so devoted eve stands vigil over her father  who constantly asks for his favorite daughter georgia  while running her own business ( planning special events ) and caring for her son ( jesse james ) .   ( some comic relief comes when maddy also drops off her ailing st . bernard for eve to care for . )  the tension builds until all three sisters are finally in one room at one of eves events where georgia is the keynote speaker .  theres a superficial resemblance to shakespeares  king lear  ( senile king with three daughters : one devoted saint and two selfish bitches )  but the material is apparently drawn from life .  sister screenwriters delia and nora ephron had parents who were a successful hollywood writing team .  henry and phoebe ephron collaborated on 17 screenplays  including  desk set  and  theres no business like show business .    ( delias novel  the basis for the film  is dedicated to henry ) .  surprisingly  the script is as thin as an anorexics wet dream .  the virtue of a semi-autobiographical project would seem to be the wealth of material available .  yet  the ephrons provide only the barest minimum of information about their characters .  also  the spaces they inhabit seem artificial .  eve lives in a house that looks like a magazine layout ; no matter how put-upon she is  we cant feel sorry for anyone whose house is so pristine on any given day .  georgia is a famous magazine editor  and in her brief scenes while she chats on a cell phone with eve seem like the photo spread for a profile .  when we first meet maddy  shes fishing at a picturesque mountain stream .  i expected to see the credit  cinematography by vanity fair .    and  yes  diane keaton is literally old enough to be lisa kudrows mother .  to her credit  though  she looks young enough to pull it off .  the one redeeming aspect of  hanging up  is that  at its core  is a truth about siblings .  theres always one on which everyone else in the family relies  freeing the others to be selfish and emotionally distant .  my wife is the reliable child in her family ; for better or worse  my brother has the role in mine .   ( being selfish and emotionally distant may not be fulfilling  but it is a lot less work ) .  if you have nothing better to do than watch this movie  look for a powerful cameo by cloris leachman as the sisters mother pat .  in a devastating scene  eve discovers that her mother doesnt love her .  although leachman is best known for comedies like  young frankenstein  and  the mary tyler moore show   her performance here reminded me of the considerable dramatic talent she displayed in  the last picture show .   bottom line : everyone involved has lived in hollywood so long they dont recognize real life anymore .  , NEGthis is the worst movie ive seen since the  so bad i walked out on it   jingle all the way  .  it is crap on toast made of crap baked in a an oven fueled by crap .  it is crap through and through .  nothing works in this film  as to be expected from joel schumacher  who has made only one watchable film in his entire career ( that being  cousins  ) .  heres a man who admits hes a medicore director  a rather charmingly self-effacing statement .  but truth be told  he is much worse than mediocre .  not all scorn should be heaped on schumacher though -- akiva goldsman should not be allowed to write ever again .  there is no plot anywhere  and the  dialogue  is unrelentingly shallow  preposterous  and boring .  they set up mr . freeze as a tragic figure trying to cure his cryogenically frozen wife  then completely sabotage his character by giving him the lamest one-liners .  it turns him into a stock maniacal villain who thoroughly enjoys his villainy instead of a brooding scientist who has spent much of his life to bringing his wife from the brink of death .  but thats par for course -- nothing in this film makes any sense  including half of arnold schwarzeneggers lines .  as mr . freeze  arnold is given way too much dialogue to spit out at once .  this is the same problem he had in  jingle all the way   and it seems that his austrian accent is getting thicker and more unintelligible as the days pass .  personally  i think that he has more pull with the directors and doesnt retake scenes to make him understandable .  compare his dialogue in the terminator series to the load of nonsense that streams forth in  batman & robin  .  apparently  james cameron knows how to get a competent performance out of arnold .  uma thurman is not as bad  but nothing resembling good either .  her poison ivy vamps around terribly  chewing up scenery left and right .  and her pamela isley scenes are marred by sub-snl standard  acting   as if shes reading off cue cards and is about to laugh at any given moment .  given the  script   its a wonder it didnt happen more frequently .  there is no redeeming feature in this film -- not george clooney as batman  chris odonnell as robin  nor alicia silverstone as batgirl .  michael gough is eerily sickly looking as alfred  as if the conceit of his illness was prompted by his cadaverous appearance .  in fact  there was something unsettling about his appearance  which seems to have been accomplished without any make-up tricks  looking as if it were scenes from a documentary about a dying man .  unfortunately  every scene about alfreds sickness is bungled with such incompetence that there is absolutely no emotional resonance -- they just go through the motions  losing whatever impact the scenes were supposed to impart .  the movie is rife with poorly choreographed fights scenes that never give any sense of a big battle -- you know theres a bunch of people  but instead of a melee  schumacher decided to focus on a foot or a fist .  theres never a moment of awe  wonder  or mayhem .  the only interesting part of the battles scenes are the freezing effects  which are impressive ( and probably expensive ) .  even then  the fights are so full of camp and stupidity that they become unwatchable .  the hockey team from hell ?  not even the tv series got that stupid ( at least not on the grand scale of stupidity that  batman & robin  showcases ) .  frustrating too are the various supporting characters that walk on and off with nothing to say or do .  blink  and youll miss elle macpherson as julie madison  vivica fox as a  why is she even in the film  vamp in freezes lair ( with all of two lines )  and pat hingle as the most ineffectual commissioner gordan the batman series ever had .  and in what almost seems like an effort to save on costs  vendela kirsebom has no lines as mrs . fries -- she isnt even filmed well enough to look good ( trust me  shes quite attractive outside of this dreck ) .  and as if the film werent bad enough to limp along with bad direction  bad dialogue  bad performances  and bad fight scenes  there are inconsistencies and illogic galore .  i know its nit-picky to ask where the hundreds of feet of cable are stored in the batarangs  why the characters arms arent ripped out of their sockets when they accomplish a one-armed batarang save after falling hundreds of feet ( while holding on to another person no less )  or where the moisture comes from when freezes weapon creates tons if ice .  thats all traditional comic book stuff .  but why does batman spring a trap for freeze at a public charity event that endanger the lives of hundreds of by-standers ?  why is there a big switch clearly marked   heat  in mr . freezes lair ?  why do countless bumbling police officers even try to take on mr . freeze hand to hand ?  why does alfred encourage silverstone to become batgirl and even go so far as to have a suit made for her ?  why do batman & robin take 10 minutes to bicker before leaving the batcave in response to an emergency ?  and since it established early on that ivy is using pheromones  why dont they wear masks to filter it out ?  i could go on and on .    batman & robin  is a braindead  pointless  garish  loud film that should still reign as the  worst film of the year  by the time 1998 rolls along .  note to warner bros . -- if youre going to make another batman film  please replace schumacher with nearly anyone .  because it could actually get worse than this .  what schumacher does not understand is that  comic book  doesnt automatically equal unbearable idiocy .  the true equation seems to be schumacher + batman = unbearable idiocy .  , NEGwhen i ponder childhood memories past  one of the things that always springs immediately to mind is watching the  inspector gadget  tv show with my older brother .  truth be told  we were rabid fanatics ; our version of cowboys and indians was chasing each other around our coffee table to the theme tune  alternating who would get to be gadget and who would be stuck playing the part of dr . claw  the inspectors arch nemesis .  i was never a biggie on nostalgia  but you just cant help but have fond memories of something like that .  sometimes i even find myself up at 4am watching re-runs of my favorite episodes  trying to recapture some of that sense of wonder i felt as a kid .  at the very least  i was expecting the new film version of the classic television series to have at least some kind of similar effect on me .  despite how horrid a film may be  the simple task of rekindling even a slight feeling of nostalgia is pretty tough to screw up .  so back i sat  with minimum expectations of what the movie would deliver ( lets face it ; exactly how good can a live-action disney film really be ? ) .  i was wise enough to steer clear from the likes of mr . magoo and george of the jungle ( two previous disney adaptations )  and i wish to god that i had been sharp enough to skip gadget as well .  rarely has a movie left me with such an utter feeling of emptiness .  as everyone else was getting up to exit the screening room after the movie had completed its assault on mankind  i was left sitting there  absolutely speechless and totally dumbfounded at what i had just seen .  can something this awful truly exist in such an evolved world ?  right from the beginning  i knew i was in trouble .  in the opening scenes  each character is introduced as if their sole purpose is to just be  to simply serve as real-life duplicates of their cartoon clones .  when referring to them  people almost yell in fear that the audience will not catch on as to who a certain character is supposed to be (  oh  hi penny !  is brain with you ?  ) .  creating one-dimensional replicas is one thing ; having mere names take the place of them is quite another .  the  plot   shall we call it  stays fairly in tune with the original series .  matthew broderick stars as john brown ( how creative is that ? )   a security guard who is horribly injured by a pack of ruthless businessmen headed by scolex ( why  rupert everett  for the love of god why ? ? ? ! ! ! )  who himself is transformed into claw by an unfortunate chain of events .  brown is then rescued and used as a prototype for a new law-enforcement technology wherein hes joined with various machine parts and some nifty gadgets to form ( drumroll  please ) . . .  inspector gadget !  >from here on out  the movie becomes a hodgepodge of stupid dialog and confusing situations ( although  to be fair  my confusion could have been caused by the virtual concussion the film was inflicting upon my fragile mind ) .  theres something about an evil gadget taking over the city ( his first crime must have been swiping matt dillons dentures from theres something about mary ) and it all ends with ( what else ? ) a bunch of post-credit nonsense and a cameo by don adams himself .  to be honest  i wasnt much paying attention to these  treats  .  i was just glad that it was over .  , NEGperhaps if the impostors didnt have so much going for it  it wouldnt have been such a tremendous disappointment .  written  directed  and produced by one of its two stars  stanley tucci  whose last picture was the indie smash hit  big night  the impostors almost never catches fire .  sputtering like a two-day old campfire  the story plays like an ad-lib sketch that was never polished or completed .  the films other star  oliver platt  was hilarious as the senators aide in bulworth .  the bloated supporting cast is a veritable cornucopia of acting talent  including woody allen  steve buscemi  hope davis  alfred molina  campbell scott  lili taylor and tony shalhoub .  all are wasted save allen  who plays a theatrical director who stares in disbelief at the bad acting before his eyes .   ( the audience will easily identify with allens sentiments . )  with the exception of a single original joke involving mirror-imaged subtitles  the movie engenders little genuine laughter .  the stale humor is so embarrassingly bad that you will find yourself laughing sporadically at the picture rather than with it .  the plot for the movie involves two starving actors  maurice ( oliver platt ) and arthur ( stanley tucci )  who accidentally end up on a cruise ship .  in order to escape an angry shakespearean actor ( alfred molina )  who is chasing them  they dress up as ships stewards .  the over-the-top script has the subtlety of a sledgehammer .  when the leads hide from their pursuers  arthur covers maurices mouth as he suffers an unending sneeze .  at other times  we have the typical zany comedy routine where everyone chases everyone else  while darting in and out of staterooms .  with the films chapters introduced like placards at a vaudeville stage  it is clear the movie wants to be taken as farce .  the press notes describes how everyone that came on the set remarked at what a good time all of the actors were having .  too bad they werent more concerned with the audiences potential enjoyment .  the jokes  frequently framed in silence  fall like stones with such intensity that one can almost hear them hitting the ground .  one wonders if anyone ever viewed the films dailies .  surely  if they had  they would have realized what leaden results they were producing .  it is tricky having good actors play bad ones  but  if they couldnt pull it off  they should have just given up .    the show is over for this fella   steve buscemis character says towards the end .  the mystery is why they didnt all give up in the beginning .  there must have been a better script somewhere for such a wonderful cast .  the impostors runs 1 : 42 .  it is rated r for a little profanity and would be fine for kids around 12 and up .  , NEGthis was the last carry on movie ( if you discount carry on columbus as a carry on movie ) and was made by a new production company .  based in central london  this movie is about the attempts by emmanuelle prevert ( suzanne danielle ) to bed her husband emile the french ambassador ( kenneth williams ) .  when he seems unwilling  she is given his permission to bed anyone she likes  such as the prime minister and the u . s . ambassador .  her antics get her into trouble and the british press spread these rumours all over their front pages .  she is invited to talk on television to set the record straight but only confirms the rumours instead .  meanwhile  theodore valentine ( larry dann ) is in love with emmannuelle after a chance encounter in the toilet of the concorde and is determined to marry her .  however  she is only interested in restoring her husbands ardour which seems a little difficult after emiles accident with a church spire !  this film is the second worst carry on movie  the worst being carry on england .  it is embarassing to see some of the remaining regulars struggle through this diabolical script by lance peters and try to pull off some of the crude and tasteless jokes that he has written .  newcomers suzanne danielle and beryl reid ( as mrs . valentine ) are mildly funny  but larry dann as theodore is excruciatingly bad .  kenneth williams only appears in a few scenes and his lacklustre performance is warranted  given the script .  the small parts for jack douglas as lyons the butler  joan sims as mrs . dangle  kenneth connor as leyland the chauffeur  and peter butterworth as richmond  are worthless and embarassing .  in fact  all four parts are surplus to requirements .  however  the only humourous scene in the film is when the four of them and emmannuelle talk about their most amourous escapades .  an awful script  a terrible collection of jokes  very poor production values ( especially the scene where emmannuelle takes her clothes off at st . james palace )  a ludicrous and cringeworthy musical score  and a non-existent plot or storyline .  its just a succession of awful set pieces about who emmannuelle will bed next !  jack douglas is not so annoying but is more boring  joan sims and peter butterworth are wasted  and kenneth connor and kenneth williams put in some poor performances as leyland and emile .  a complete waste of time  this movie was trying to catch up with the new sexually permissive seventies .  it was a certificate 15 film but by 1978  there was little interest in this kind of film and it flopped at the box office and was only given its premiere on uk terrestrial television in april 1998 !  avoid at all costs !  , NEGif youre debating whether or not to see _breakfast_of_champions_  ask yourself one simple question : do you want to see nick nolte in lingerie ?  the only people who would get much enjoyment from alan rudolphs chaotic adaptation of the kurt vonnegut novel is the cross-section of the population with the unhealthy urge to see that unpleasant sight .  everyone else--and im hoping thats most people--would be wise to steer clear of this excrutiatingly unfunny mess .  actually  though  the sight of nolte in high heels is one of the more amusing things about this muddle  which focuses dwayne hoover ( bruce willis )  the owner of dwayne hoovers exit 11 motor village in midland city .  not only is he a huge success as a businessman  hes also something of a celebrity  his face made recognizable by an ongoing series of television commercials .  with a nice home and family to boot  dwayne appears to have it all the ingredients to be happy--yet hes not .  his wife celia ( barbara hershey ) is perpetually in a pill-induced haze ; his son george ( lukas haas ) is a flamboyant lounge singer who goes by the stage name  bunny .   not only that  the environmental protection agency is on dwaynes ass over a building development project .  its enough to send dwayne on a nervous breakdown--that is  if he doesnt succeed in blowing his brains out first .  meanwhile  midland city is about to host a fine arts festival  and the guest of honor is one kilgore trout ( albert finney )  a writer who is far from the renowned author the festivals organizer ( buck henry ) was led to believe--in fact  hes a penniless hack who writes second-rate sci-fi that appears in porn magazines .  his trek to midland city is also a spiritual journey  one that reaches its apex after meeting dwayne  who for some reason thinks that trout will hold for him all of lifes answers .  the above is already a longer plot synopsis than i usually give in my reviews  but  ironically  i have barely scratched the surface .  i havent yet mentioned wayne hoobler ( omar epps )  an ex-con with an obsessive admiration for the similarly-named dwayne .  then theres the matter of francine ( glenne headly )  dwaynes devoted secretary .  not to mention dwaynes employee and old friend harry lesabre ( nolte )  the one with the secret penchant for cross-dressing .  and so on .  the film is essentially dwaynes story  but too often rudolph goes on distracting tangents with the eccentric peripheral players that one often wonders what the point is .  rudolph does arrive at a point ( more on that later )  but its blunted and obscured by his hyperactive approach to the material .  the surreal visual style  complete with printed words flying through the air and into dwaynes ears  is obviously meant to convey a sense of madness  but its bludgeoning nature is likely to make viewers mad .  the actors are called on to act accordingly  resulting in some of the worst  most overdone work all of them have ever turned in .  willis fares best of all--but thats because his frozen expression of befuddled bewilderment mirrors that of the audience .  with such an aggressively outrageous atmosphere for nearly all of its running time  it comes as a shock when things suddenly turn serious  and rudolph tries to make a statement .  unlike _american_beauty_ ( a film that _breakfast_ resembles in more than a few ways  to its great detriment )  there isnt any palpably earnest undercurrent that would prepare the audience for the big shift .  as such  the cartoony characters fail to win a sympathy that needs to be earned ; and the film attempts  to no avail  to reach a profundity that it doesnt deserve .  vonneguts original novel is considered a classic  but it had been called unfilmable--the same that was said of hunter s . thompsons _fear_and_loathing_in_las_vegas_  which was disastrously committed to film last year by terry gilliam .  with the similar failure of _breakfast_of_champions_  will hollywood ever learn that books labeled  unfilmable  inevitably results in a film that is unwatchable ?  likely not .  , NEGsuicide is pointless  everyone should know that .  so whats this movie like ?  you guessed it . . .  pointless .  the virgin suicides focuses on the lives of the five lisbon sisters  from the perspective of the teenage boys who are fascinated by them .  when the youngest lisbon sister commits suicide  it sets in motion a series of events that will change the lives of many people forever .  thats what the press materials for the film probably say .  now heres what i say : the virgin suicides is a huge waste of time .  boring  arty  pretentious junk that is about as entertaining as . . .  well as committing suicide .  the movie lost me early on  immediately following the scene where the younger daughter jumps to her death from her bedroom window .  the girls father ( james woods ) holds her lifeless body in his arms as their horrified family looks on .  then  as the scene ends  the lawn sprinklers come on .  is that a joke ?  is that supposed to be amusing in some way ?  from then on  the movie failed to draw me back in .  performances are the only saving grace of the virgin suicides .  woods plays the only character who would actually interest me when he came onscreen  but the performance of kirsten dunst as the next youngest daughter lux is worth mentioning as well .  dunst has the potential to be a big star  if she chooses her projects well .  and while this film is awful  she manages to come away from it virtually unscathed .  there are also a few cameos in the film here and there  which only frustrate the audience as they leave you wanting more .  as a result  they all seem rather pointless ( although theres a brief role given to michael pare from eddie and the cruisers which turns out to be his best role since . . .  well since eddie and the cruisers ) .  perhaps the virgin suicides would have worked had the story not been told from the point of view of people who had very little access to the main characters .  we never get any significant insight into the girls and why they might be feeling what theyre feeling .  all we really know is that mrs . lisbon ( kathleen turner ) is strict and keeps them on a short leash .  what mother doesnt ?  its certainly no reason to commit suicide .  with the godfather part iii  sofia coppola proved that she had no business being in front of the camera .  with the virgin suicides  she proves she has no business behind it either .  having family connections doesnt entitle you to be allowed to make movies .  so attention film directors . . .  stop letting your daughters pout their way into the industry .  just because they share your dna doesnt mean they share your talent .  [r]  , NEGthe realm of science fiction has always been an allegory of political and or moral sensibilities .  the best tales of the genre deal with mankinds struggle for survival or knowledge .  such popular and noteworthy tomes as  stranger in a strange land  by robert heinlein   childhoods end  by arthur c . clarke and  man in the high castle  and  do androids dream of electric sheep  by philip k . dick all deal with mans need for identity and struggle for self worth .  hollywood has regularly adapted the milieu ( if not the message ) of science fiction since its beginnings .  most films just created fancy pulp tales with no more thought that the escapism they achieved .  it really wasnt until producer george pal  took charge of robert heinleins novel  rocketship galileo  and crafted the film  destination moon   that sci-fi ( as it is commonly referred to )  came into its own .  from there  such diverse filmmakers as roger corman to stanley kubrick  have sought to express ideas through the medium of the genre .  with the release of touchstone pictures  mission to mars   we have an unabashedly nonchalant sci-fi film for those who read the national enquirer and the globe .  the film opens on a summer barbecue  as phil ohlmyer ( jerry oconnell ) woos a young female with his tales of space glory and the upcoming mission .  woody blake ( tim robbins ) and his wife terri ( connie nielsen ) commit to his coming authority on the mission  and luc goddard ( don cheadle ) consoles his son .  entering the party is jim mcconnell ( gary sinise )  who gave up command of the mission due to the untimely death of his wife  maggie ( kim delaney ) .  luc consoles jim with woodys assistance .  the three men are friends and carry a fine bond of trust and caring between them .  but jim still longs to set foot on the red planet .  the mission is in earnest as luc and his team land in the cydonia region of mars .  they send out the rover to investigate the area and discover what seems to be water or ice under the surface .  going out to investigate  luc and his team approach the famed face on mars .  a strange noise emanates from the rock .  as the team tries to scan through the rock with radar  a violent wind storm erupts  creating a vortex that kills all members of the team  save for luc .  back on the space station orbiting earth  woody and jim receive the information that the mars landing team is missing .  lucs interference laden emergency message urges the two men to attempt a second mission to the red planet in the hopes of rescuing the previous team .  the second journey to the martian world is fraught with danger .  meteorite showers  explosions  and rescues all come into play as the intrepid heroes make there way to the planets surface .  the big question is  is there now or has there ever been intelligent life on mars .  and if so  what is its relationship with us ?  now for the bad news .  the entire plot of  mission to mars  is based almost wholeheartedly on outdated and preposterous national enquirer type martian civilization tripe .  the famed face on mars becomes the centerpiece of the film  revealing some of the most harebrained sci-fi pabulum the screen has witnessed .  borrowing ideas from such films as  robinson crusoe on mars  ( 1964 )  quatermass and the pit ( 1967 )   2001 : a space odyssey   and even mario bavas  planet of the vampires  ( terrore nello spazio ) ( 1965 )   mission to mars  is a hodgepodge of ideas that dont add up to a satisfying whole .  while some sequences are wonderfully handled and executed  the film remains flat and un-involving .  so much time is giving to establishing the lead characters in the film  but to no good use .  the performances are all workmen like  with only don cheadle ( as luc ) carrying any sort of real chemistry .  gary sinise is wasted in role that requires him to look as if he is experiencing sleep depravation .  and the mistaken idea of having jerry oconnell ( as phil ohlmyer ) play his part for comic relief is just too painful to excuse .  and the less said about tim robbins called in from home performance the better .  hes just having too much fun here to give a damn .  the script has a few lapses  namely that after discovering several breaches in the hull of the ship caused by a meteorite shower  no one thinks of checking the fuel tanks or the remainder of the ship for damage .  this of course leads to our heroes having to abandon their rescue ship .  also  when one character sacrifices himself  the character takes on a religious demeanor that is completely at odds with the situation .  but the biggest offence in the film is the horrid  intrusive score by ennio morricone .  subtlety is non-existent here .  in fact in some scenes the music becomes so extravagant that dialogue is almost drowned out .  the only sequence in which the score almost works is during the protracted meteorite shower .  the pacing of the film is very leisurely .  after the opening introduction of the characters ( which lasts a full 22 minutes )  we are finally dropped onto the martian surface .  then  there is another long pause in the plot for more character development  including an elaborate dance sequence in zero gravity .  the film could lose about 30 minutes and actually gain some momentum .  there are so many scenes of talking heads  discussing what we already know is going to happen  that it drags the film to a dead stop .  the good news is that the film is absolutely sumptuous to look at .  the vistas of the planet mars are majestic and awe inspiring .  the design of the numerous spacecraft and suits are all expertly drafted  with a level of realism that hasnt been seen since  2001 : a space odyssey  .  the visual effects are just stunning  from the space walk sequences  to the visualization of evolution on earth .  the only fault come with the martians themselves  which look more like something out of a plastic model kit than something from another world .  director de palma stages some wonderfully creative scenes through out the film .  the opening sequence alone in a seemingly un-interrupted cut lasting almost 15 minutes ( an homage to hitchcocks  rope  )  as we are introduced to all of the characters .  scenes in the rescue ship  with its rotating centrifuge  are just amazing in their execution .  but the nagging question  is the final explanation worth all of this sturm und drang .  sadly it is not .  director brian de palma has crafted an extravagant production .  the set design and visual effects are all arresting .  but its the comic strip denouncement that ruin what might have been a fine return to good adventurous  thought provoking science fiction .  a disappointing film  but one that might still entertain if you can settle for the visuals .  , NEGback in february at the monthly los angeles comic book and science fiction convention  new line cinema put on a lavish presentation for its big-screen update of the cult 1960s sci-fi tv show lost in space  complete with in-person appearances by cast members mimi rogers  matt leblanc  lacey chabert  jack johnson  and even gary oldman .  that should have set off my warning alarms--the last time such an extravagant film presentation took place at the convention was nearly five years ago  when none other than arnold schwarzenegger made an in-person cameo to peddle . . .  last action hero .  but no  like millions of others  i bought into the hype and  got lost .   if only i had gotten lost--literally--on the way to theatre and spared myself the tedium of this sloppily slapped-together blockbuster wannabe .  you may find yourself wondering if director stephen hopkins and screenwriter akiva goldsman were lost themselves when they made the film .  at the convention  goldsman claimed to be a rabid fan of the original television series  and if that really is the case  id hate to see what he does with concepts he only has mild interest in .  to say that his script lacks narrative cohesion is to imply that there is a narrative to begin with--which there most certainly is not .  after the setup  in which the robinson family--father john ( william hurt  looking and sounding as spaced out as he does in interviews )  mother maureen ( rogers  wasted )  daughters judy ( heather graham  ditto ) and penny ( a heavily made-up chabert  looking like a junior version of neve campbell in wild things )  and son will ( young newcomer johnson  making the best of it ) --and pilot don west ( leblanc  doing a bad han solo impression ) find themselves lost in space after their ship is sabotaged by evil stowaway dr . smith ( a watered-down but still-lively oldman  cashing a paycheck and loving every minute )  the scripts  stream  of events becomes so fragmented and random that it seems to be made up as it goes along--and hopkins does little to make what does go on the slightest bit interesting .  they encounter another ship .  they board it .  alien spiders attack them .  they return to their ship .  the other one explodes .  they land on a deserted planet .  and so on .  an attempt at a plot involving time travel occurs in the third act  but goldsman doesnt seem to understand the rules that come with using such a story device ; when one characters past self dies  the future incarnation inexplicably lives on .  the look and effects should be lost in spaces ace-in-the-hole  but hopkins even manages to botch that .  for a big-budget film  the visual effects are incredibly shoddy .  in one composite background shot  i could see the blue outline around oldman ; the various digital effects for the space battle scenes look like . . .  digital effects .  but nothing in those shots is as jaw-droppingly unconvincing as blawp  a monkey-like space creature that becomes pennys pet .  entirely computer-generated and every inch showing it  blawp looks like it was lifted directly from a sony playstation game .  apparently hopkins thought the same and tried desperately to hide it ; how else can one explain the graininess of blawps composite shots with the human actors ?  but in doing so  the seams are that much more obvious .  you have to be severely visually impaired to not be distracted when a grainy shot of penny and blawp is immediately followed by a crystal-clear solo reaction shot of judy .  new line is hoping lost in space will become a big franchise much like the long-running star trek cash cow at paramount .  i dont think so .  in a few years  the lost in space movie will likely live on not as a series but as the obscure answer to a trivia question : what film ended titanics 15-week reign at the top of the weekend box office ?  , NEGthe working title for no looking back was long time  nothing new  and rarely has there been a more apt name for a motion picture .  even though this movie clocks in at a relatively skinny 96 minutes  it seems to run long enough to engulf two titanics .  writer/director edward burns has trotted out a hackneyed storyline  the trajectory of which will be instantly recognizable to anyone who hasnt spent their life in seclusion .  instead of tweaking the formula a little to invigorate the proceedings  burns is content to allow the film to ramble aimlessly towards its irritatingly predictable conclusion  offering precious few momentary pleasures along the way .  no looking back is dominated by three very dislikable characters whose constant presence on the screen is painful .  the most appropriate ending would have been a triple suicide  and the sooner  the better .  alas  thats not the case  and those who stick with this film for its entire length will be forced to endure the prolonged company of this wretched trio .  and  to further depress audiences  burns has shot the entire film on cold  rainy days in a gray new york state beach town .  peeks of sunshine are few and far between .  no wonder the characters are all so miserable .  first of all  we have charlie ( burns )  a generation x slacker who abandoned his girlfriend three years ago after she had an abortion  then spent some time bumming around in california before deciding to come home .  that girlfriend is claudia ( lauren holly )  and  after picking up the pieces of her life following charlies departure  she has moved on  shacking up with one of charlies old school buddies  mike ( jon bon jovi ) .  the two have a comfortable relationship  but its apparent to even a blind person that theyre not right for each other .  claudia years for some spice in her life ; mike wants to settle down and have children .  then charlie re-enters the mix .  so who  if anyone  will claudia end up with ?  who cares ? ?  no looking back goes to extraordinary lengths to make sure that were not especially interested in the outcome of the romantic triangle .  so what if no one finds happiness -- these characters dont deserve it anyway  especially after wasting 90 minutes of our time .  they arent real people -- theyre a writers construct stumbling through a too-obvious storyline .  they should know the ending as well as we do .  and burns should have given his audience more credit and presented them with a plot that at least offered a surprise or two .  another frustrating thing about no looking back is that burns has populated the film with a group of potentially-interesting supporting characters .  blythe danner is solid as claudias housebound mother  connie britton is suitably high-strung as claudias neurotic sister  and jennifer esposito is eye-catching as a bartender in search of a little romance .  sadly  all we get is quick glimpses into their lives  although a movie about any of them would have been far more intriguing than the story burns has chosen to tell .  none of the lead performers are going to wow critics with their thespian attributes .  edward burns is pushing the edge of his limited range here .  jon bon jovi shows more acting ability than one might reasonably expect from a singer branching into a different career  but he could still use a little polish .  the worst case is lauren holly  who presents a completely bland claudia .  as portrayed here  shes hardly the kind of woman who would inspire even a moments interest  not to mention undying love .  burns ex  the monumentally untalented maxine bahns  would have been hard-pressed to do a less inspired job .  when he released the brothers mcmullen  edward burns was revered as the wunderkind of the 1995 sundance film festival ( robert redford has apparently stuck with him -- the aging actor/director executive produced this mess ) .  two films and three short years later  the luster has faded .  some movie makers have only one good film in them .  with back- to-back duds like shes the one and no looking back to follow the delightful brothers  burns is beginning to look like a member of that undistinguished club .  , NEGthe job of the film critic is to see a movie and write a review of it that tells you what its about and why its good or bad .  i feel kind of embarrassed to admit this  but i after having seen  get carter  i really cant tell you what its about although i could go on and on about how and why its a bad movie .    get carter  falls into that category of ? movies that continue to be made for reasons unknown to anyone outside of a hollywood executive board room .  you might call them the  steven seagal/mickey rourke/jean-claude van damme/wesley snipes school of mediocre action/crime thrillers .   you know - the potboilers that are heavy on fistfights  shoot-outs and car chases but really light on plot and character development .  they have stories where the so-called hero just keeps running into characters who have some connection to one of the other characters who are all antagonists without a reason for being in the movie other than to give the protagonist someone to fight  chase or shoot at .  sylvester stallone stars as jack carter  a las vegas-based mob enforcer who returns home * for his brothers funeral .  he believes his brother ? richie was  taken out  and didnt die from a dwi accident .  carters one of the most cliche bad-asses ever captured on celluloid .  his face alone is pretty intimidating and theres quite a few scenes in which he leans on both regular citizens and criminal lowlives simply by staring them down and speaking with confidence in his  rambo-on-testosterone-therapy  voice .  stallones performance in this movie is so forced and unnatural he doesnt realize hes mocking himself .  the actual story involves carters investigation into his brother richies death .  hes in a town thats not his but somehow the local top dogs know him very well .  mickey rourke co-stars as one of these characters  a sort of crime boss who has something to do with running a porno web site and blackmailing a young internet tycoon ( played by alan cummings looking and acting a lot like pee wee herman ) .  theres also another plot involving richies mistress  a secret cd-rom with some convicting and disturbing evidence on it and something terrible involving one of carters still-living relatives .  im rolling my eyes just thinking about trying to critique all this in a way that could be remotely comprehendible .  i could just rip the screenplay to shreds  plus the direction or the editing or the production values but that would require discussion of nearly every scene in order to explain it all .  i dont like to put spoliers in my reviews either intentionally or accidentally .  yes   get carter  is just that complicated and complex .  and whats worse is that its not this intricate to make it seem smart like  the usual suspects  for example - just the opposite .  you get the feeling whoever wrote this script did it in short intervals spaced far apart and they probably didnt remember what had already happened and didnt figure out how each scene would lead in to the next one or how the major plot points would work towards the climax .  all you really need to know is that most of the film is just scenes of carter tracking down one scumbag or supposed witness after another  asking them what they know  getting information and then realizing that if he wasnt a complete idiot he could have figured it out in the first five minutes .  although the supporting characters are equally stupid themselves since they tell him everything which comes back to haunt them in one violent way or another .  making a movie entirely about criminals doesnt necessarily mean they have to be unlikable and cliche cutout characters .  mel gibson starred in  payback  a few years ago that had a story not unlike this one but had such a good screenplay you couldnt help but like him even though he was just as bad a guy as jack carter .  so ultimately  get carter  fails for pretty much every selling point it has .  carter is not a likable character and you really dont care if he gets revenge or not .  the action sequences are not at all exciting or original .  the enemies and their massive conspiracy are not threatening at all ( cmon  you know whos going to win every brawl and shoot-out and car chase ) .  in the end you dont feel nearly satisfied with the results .  the filmmakers did a good job in doing everything as unoriginal as possible .   * the city is never mentioned by name but i assume its seattle since all the cars have washington license plates and its always raining .  , NEGive got to admit it . . .  im a huge jim carrey fan .  i loved the first ace ventura  as well as the mask and dumb and dumber--and even in batman forever ( which was a pretty awful movie )  carrey was one of the few people to come off looking reasonably good .  until i saw ace ventura 2  i had no idea how people could find the guy annoying .  sadly  ace ventura 2 shows just how irritating and annoying carrey can be .  carrey goes through the same schtick he went through in the first ace movie  but this time it is no longer funny--it is just a rehash of many of the same jokes used in ace i .  the plot sees pet detective ace ventura retiring after failing to save a raccoon ( in a reasonable cliffhanger spoof ) .  soon he is called out of retirement to find a bat which was kidnapped and  if not returned in four days  will cause two warring african tribes to destroy each other .  once again  its up to ace to save the day  using his uncanny detective skills .  those who have been disappointed by carreys more restrained roles in the films following the first ace ventura may be glad to see him over-acting to the best of his ability  but some may be disappointed by the fact that this sequel doesnt capture the feel of the original .  the original benefited from what looked to be carreys constant hyped-up improv sequences  which were hysterically funny .  here  however  the tighter script ( which is reminiscent of the old disney telemovies ) takes the improvised material from the first  and shamelessly recycles it in the new movie  giving carrey little chance to improvise .  instead  his extremely funny manner has been reduced to just walking around stupidly .  but one of the biggest problems i had was with the character of ventura himself .  in the first movie  he was always cool  and one step ahead of every one else--perfect for carreys off-the-wall approach .  but here  ventura is made to look a lot stupider  and is often made out as the straight guy--a role which is definitely not carreys style .  there are definitely some very funny moments  but they are few and far between .  they are also nowhere near as funny as anything carrey did in the first ace ventura  or even dumb and dumber .  , NEGfor about twenty minutes into mission impossible 2 director john woo ( the killer  hard boiled  face off ) appears to have made an exciting  elegant  charming spy thriller  kind of a post millennium james bond adventure with a strapping american ( read : unsophisticated ) hero more willing to drop kick villains than out fox them .  sadly  as the picture progresses  the final product begins to bear a closer resemblance to a souped up  two-hour long episode of magyuver .  and not a particularly good one at that .  what went wrong ?  mi2 begins flashily enough  that initial flash leading us to believe that itll soon give way to something of a plot  but it only gives way to more flash  then digresses further into a presumably unintentional parody of itself with much slo mo posturing and countless action set pieces wherein bad guys seem to deliberately leap into the way of tom cruises firing gun just so they can die really cool .  early on  during a car chase between soon to be lovers ethan hunt ( tom cruise ) and nyah nordoff-hall ( thandie newton )  woo works some of his trademark magic .  in one hypnotic  though completely inexplicable sequence  the director slows the action down to a languid semi-stall as cruise and his stunning opponent stare into one and others eyes with come hither sexuality ? ? ? just as their respective cars smash and spin in accordance  coming ever so close to toppling over a neighboring cliff .  prior to this we see the famed trailer opener of cruise climbing a steep mountain  sans scaffolding  then leaping from one jagged rock formation to another .  why ?  i havent the foggiest .  i doubt even john woo could provide you with a logical reply .  with mi2 woo has become a slave to the summer movie machine  the one that jettisons logic for gravity defying effects and story for more gravity defying effects .  its possible that these  spies  could be adrenaline junkies climbing mountains and crashing into each other as means to get off  though of course this is never explored .  the scenes ive described are really only included to titillate  not to give any insight into character .  god forbid .  woo certainly knows how to make each set piece energetic  but they remain individual set pieces never connecting to form anything more than splices of beer commercial-like visuals .  still in terms of crackerjack eye candy  the opening has much to cherish .  cruise and newton first meet during a vigorous flamenco dance featuring several welcome woo devices ( the graceful slow mo artistry of synchronized movement juxtaposed against the stage 1 romance of two attractive individuals discovering how attractive the other is ) .  between the frantic dancing  woo trains his camera on cruise and newton as they make with some sensuous eye contact .  the scene is a little over the top in a bon jovi music video circa 1988 kind of way  yet it has style and something of soul  and woo casts a bit of a spell on us .  sure its all smoke and mirrors  but we can see that there happens to be a talented maestro behind this particular product .  thandie and cruise later meet in a bathtub in a scene thats about half as playfully charming as the jennifer lopez \ george cloony trunk meeting in out of sight .  they flirt and exchange obvious double entendres .  newton bats her eyes flirtatiously .  cruise grins a little too slyly .  the cruise character  ethan hunt  has been drastically altered since the first film .  here cruise plays him more as a hip  sexual dynamo than the square jawed robot he impersonated in part 1 .  hes cool and dashing  which is precisely the kind of role we want to see cruise in after watching him sleep walk through eyes wide shut ( which might just be the longest episode of red show diaries ever committed to film )  and blustered his way through magnolia ( quite possibly the most overrated performance of the 90s ) .  sadly as the film progresses we see less of cruises initial  im the man !   charm and more slo-mo close-ups of his preening mug .  mi2 falls apart on nearly every level during its repetitious third act  which is essentially one hour long action sequence that just wont stop .  the whole thing commences with an utterly generic gun battle ( the first gun fight in the film )  which really should be unheard of in a john woo film  but alas this particular battle couldve been staged by anyone from renny harlin to joseph merhi ( of course excepting the  symbolic  pigeons who seem to find their way into every john woo picture ) .  weve all seen guys slide across the floor in slo mo while firing a gun in each hand .  it isnt done any differently here .  the action is pure hard target \ broken arrow theatrics with nothing to propel it but the apparent need to see tom cruise drop kick face less villains while his hair whips stylishly in the wind .  hes cool for sure but hes made to be as empty as the movie .  the actor isnt used so much for his boyish appeal as for his chiseled looks ; he smiles narcissistically into the camera at literally any moment  be it during a gunfight  before one or after one .  when hes not beaming away  hes staring into the lens with cold eyes trying to look mad as hell  but woos editing seriously undermines the effort .  he fetishizes cruises angular face with such glee that it turns into a naked gun style spoof .  i half expected cruise to peel off his facemask and reveal that hes really austin powers .  in a classic woo action moment  ethan hunt struts past a fiery doorway glaring at the baddies within its frame like a pin-up boy angel of death .  the gunfight turns into a daring escape which turns into a reckless mission which turns into a motorcycle attack in which bad guys seem to angle directly for cruise to kill them like some kind of mass suicide ritual ( one dumb bastard even jumps his bike over the gun toting cruise  basically inviting our handsome hero to shoot him in mid air which he does ) .  the lead bad guy ( played by the appropriately british dougray scott ) and cruise face off in a mentally deficient game of chicken ? ? ? on motorcycles .  though instead of jumping off to the side at the last moment  the two grown men leap directly into the other giving each other a mid air bear hug  only to fly about a hundred feet ( still in bear hug position )  land on a beach below and begin a mano-e-mano fist fight that ends with the bad guy pulling a  so you thought i was dead . . .  .  not to worry  cruise takes care of the problem without even breaking a sweat .  what a hero !  you may have noticed that i opted not to describe an iota of mi2s plot .  my reasoning is simple : im not sure of any good it would do .  the film itself has absolutely no concern with story  only with hurtling forth to the next  special  effect .  i wasnt kidding when i told a friend of mine that mi2 has less plot than the average aerosmith video .  nobody will go to this for the plot  and if they do theyll surely regret it .  as summer movies evolve ( or devolve ) character and plot have become increasingly whittled down to nearly nothing .  in mi  the plot seemed to be built around brian de palmas ( that films director ) stylistic flourishes  while in mi2 the plot only serves to give us an intermittent breather from woos non-stop masturbatory pandemonium .  its irrelevant in every sense  as is character .  all that ultimately matters are those pesky smoke and mirrors .  , NEGevery now and then  reviewers are faced with the films that are hard to be properly reviewed .  most of the time it happens with films that leave so overwhelming impact  either good or bad  that in the end reviewers must work hard to express his thoughts or feelings .  but  sometimes it can happen for rather trivial reasons .  i love trouble happened to be one of such occasions for the author of this review .  the impression left by the film wasnt overwhelming - on the contrary  there were hardly any impression at all  since i had real trouble keeping myself awake while watching it .  which surprise me to this day  because the movie theatre was full  i was close to sound speakers  the show wasnt late and i didnt lack sleep before the show .  such things happen very rarely to me  and  after many years  the closest thing to solution to this mystery is probably the quality of the film itself .  the plot revolves around two rival chicago reporters - old peter brackett ( nick nolte ) and young  aspiring sabrina peterson ( julia roberts ) .  two of them are assigned to cover the train collision .  as soon as they meet  they start scooping each other  but during the process they both discover sinister plot involving cancerogenic milk  and also the romantic feelings they have for each other .  the plot in this film is rather secondary to its real raison d ? tre - romantic pairing reminiscent of classical screwball comedies starring spencer tracy and katharine hepburn .  movie author  director and screenwriter charles shyer  who had some experiences with turning the screwball spirit into modern setting with father of the bride  tries again  this time pairing old nick nolte with young julia roberts .  however  although there is some chemistry between the two  soon it stops to arouse any interest .  it probably happens due to poorly executed genre mix  that collides light-hearted romantic comedy with rather uninteresting plot suitable to pure action thrillers .  shyer as director fails to make the proper transition between the two  and fails in both areas  making the story cliched and predictable .  the end result is rather forgettable effort  which convinced me not to watch movie again .  ill give it the benefit of the doubt  though .  , NEGthe only two really good things that i can say about tarzan and the lost city are as follows : jane march was very cute as jane  and the movie was thankfully under 90 minutes in length .  if you havent already figured it out  i didnt like this movie very much .  the plot was boring and contrived to the extreme .  tarzan ( casper van dien ) has now left the jungle and living in civilized society .  he is just days away from his impending marriage to jane  played by the aptly named jane march .  back in his former home of africa  a group of looters has found the key to locating a lost city .   ( mind you i never really figured out why they actually wanted to find this city . )  anyway  tarzans old jungle friend appears to him in a vision .  tarzan realizes that he must return to africa to help stop the bad guys from finding the lost city .  he leaves jane ( his first mistake  in my opinion ) and travels to africa .  of course  jane is hot on her ape mans heals .  the two of them are reunited in africa where they do battle with the bad guys .  sound like a dumb explanation of the plot ?  its actually an improvement over the real thing .  the acting is just plain awful .  im not quite sure what casper van dien was doing in this film  but it wasnt acting .  jane march wasnt a heck of a lot better  but at least she is easy on the eyes .  compounding the bad acting was the fact that in many places the dialogue had obviously been re-recorded  and ive seen better dubbing in some old bruce lee movies .  added to the sound problems was the cinematography .  this film was filled with beautiful african scenery .  but the panoramic scenery shots looked overexposed to me .  quite frankly  i think you could probably do a better job capturing the beauty of africa with a camcorder than this bunch did with professional film equipment .  then we have the special effects .    special effects in a tarzan movie ?   you are no doubt asking yourself ?  yes friends  the writers injected some very out of place supernatural elements into the story .  probably for the sake of using cgi  since it did nothing but hurt the story .  in most parts  they werent bad  just nothing special .  but  they were more than a little on the hokey side .  except of course  when we got to the ridiculous climax of this movie .  the grand finales special effects went right into the toilet at that point .  it almost looked like they had run out of money .  these effects were of noticeably lower quality than those in the rest of the film and looked like something in an amateur video production .  i took one lesson away from watching tarzan and the lost city -- ape men and bones that morph into skeletal warriors dont mix .  stay far away from this version of tarzan .  , NEGsilly performances and some huge gaps in logic mar an otherwise interesting tale of an eclectic group of people stranded at  the last stop cafe and motel  due to heavy snowfall .  one of the stranded is a colorado state highway patrolman ( adam beach ) who discovers a murder scene and a bag full of cash from a recent bank robbery .  someone amongst the group of strangers is a bank robber and a murderer  but is it the same person or are there multiple criminals ?  adam beach unfortunately was the wrong choice for the lead in this film .  he doesnt play the role with enough seriousness to be believable or enough goofiness for it to be funny .  his performance is stuck somewhere in the middle  and this film really needed it to be on one side or the other .  rose mcgowan is cold and unpleasant to the eye as always  and jurgen prochnow . . .  what on earth is he doing in this ?  best performance comes from william s . taylor as a cheesy ( yet still somehow cool and confident ) wayne newton drifter type .  the last stop is available on dvd from sterling home entertainment .  as usual with sterling  theyve filled out this dvd with extra features .  the disc contains the film in its original aspect ratio of 1 . 85 : 1  a choice of 2 . 0 dolby surround sound or 5 . 1 dolby digital surround sound  a full length audio commentary track with director mark malone  interviews with the cast and crew  the original trailer  and the usual cast and crew biographies .  the film itself might not be the greatest  but sterlings effort of adding decent extra features while keeping the price affordable ( suggested retail of $19 . 95 ) makes this dvd worth the money .  [r]  , NEGso i went and saw this film right  it was called  battlefield : earth   i was never interested in the previews  and never too terribly interested in the book  nor do i find scientology interesting  but after reading advanced reviews of how bad this film really is  i had that weird urge just to watch it .  well let me be the first to say  and so far in my view its safe to say : battlefield : earth might be the worst film i have ever seen  yes even worse than  mr . magoo    blue in the face   or  jaws : the revenge  .  roger christianson whos credits include set direction  and art direction for such great films as  alien  and  star wars   directs this film with such amateurism  that the film looks and feels and in fact sounds so dumb  that its quite depressing .  the look of the film  is dark and drabby at times  but then bright and happy at other times .  the sound is terrible  and has the worst surround sound effects ive heard .  the acting is nothing  the dialogue poor  and the make-up effects hideous .  heres the so-called plot : earth 3000 . . . . man is a endangered species  while aliens from the planet psychlo ( the aliens are named psychlo . . . i  wonder why ? ! ) are invading earth  destined to put an end to those  man-animals  to an end  and destroy earth once and for all  of course we have our typical hero ( played terrible by barry pepper  who was great in a small role in 1999s  the green mile  ) who is destined to go out  and save his planet !  one thing : he has to go up against  terl  the chief of security psychlo  who is played frankly  quite bad by john travolta  whom with dreadlocks  a big head  and green eyes just doesnt work .  of course the sidekick to terl  is played by ( lol ! ! )  forest whitaker  who looks like a deformed werewolf of some kind .  our friendly human johnny ( barry pepper ) looks just as bad as well  with long scraggly hair .  im not really sure how to quite explain the badness of this film  except just to say its terrible .  everything in this film is imcomprehinsable  from the make-up effects  which by the way arent good  to the phony looking special effects  everything in this film is faulted .  in fact i dont remember one part in this entire movie where i was having a good time  or enjoying myself .  in fact there is no part in the movie that i liked or enjoyed .  throughout the entire 127 minute running time  i was dying  constantly looking at my watch  and hoping maybe the projectioner would blow a bulb or something  sadly it didnt .  my advice to hollywood : get new scripts  new acting classes  better directors and damnit  make films like american beauty more .  , NEGby phil curtolo  madonna - antonio banderas - jonathan price - in an alan parker film - with music from andrew lloyd weber - and lyrics by tim rice - evita .   now i have to admit  the trailer for this rock-opera-turned-major motion picture is almost breath-taking for some .  the soundtrack is wonderful to listen to .  so why wouldnt the movie be wonderful to see .  simple  a little over 2 hours of constant singing can almost drive you insane .  the story of eva duarte ( madonna )  evita is full of drama thats trapped inside by all the notes and chords .  she was an orphaned child who ends up becoming a hooker  then goes into the field of acting  and finally meets juan peron ( price )  the soon-to-be first president of argentina .  they fall in love and eventually marry .  sounds pretty good  doesnt it .  well the story gets better  as eva goes on the  rainbow tour  across europe  trying to win respect .  eva duarte was a wonderful lady .  however  all of the drama-packed moments above were never understood because the actors and actresses sang to fast to be understood .  i went into theater 4 at magic cinemas with the attitude that evita was going to be terribly boring and i left with happy  because i was right .  they only thing that kept me awake during the movie was the loud bangs of the drums and strums of the guitar .  although it did come off as dull  the beautiful cinematography is eye-catching  as was madonnas performance .  as the  spiritual leader of argentina   madonna would have definitely been an oscar-contender had she spoken a single line .  but her chance was taken away with the stubbornness of making an exact replica of the broadway musical a film .  dont get me wrong and dont look at my grade .  i am not a big fan of musicals on the big screen .  if youre going to pay to see a movie  you want to see a movie .  now i have to admit  its a lot cheaper to pay $5 than $200 plus to see the play  but thats what did me in .  all this review contains is my opinion and my grade was set before i even saw the movie .  now you may be saying   what kind of critic is he ?    and youre right .  as a critic  i should have given the movie a chance .  but as a 17-year old quentin tarantino fan  it was way too hard .     , NEGi have never seen a man so in love with himself than george lucas .  with the overt success of the three original star wars films  lucas has become  not necessarily a filmmaker  but the head cheeze at a huge toy company  with the phantom menace the new product on the shelve .  only this toy was made for $115 million  but every kid wants it  and  like all other expensive toys  falls apart within an hour after playing with it .  the product in question  star wars episode 1 : the phantom menace ( jeez ! )  is pure and simple : its about the money  baby !  no one in their right mind would create such a fiasco if they knew it wouldnt make a ton of money before its fourth week of release .  i come to the sw franchise as a stranger  since i have absolutely no idea why the sw movies are so popular .  i find them rather boring and full of nothing but eye candy .  phantom menace is like the first sw  minus 10 .  nothing in the whole concept is remotely enjoyable .  even the special effects seem rather bland .  the story in this new one is a mindless mess . . . the  acting wooden . . . and the action sequences like something out of a video game .  sw : phantom menace is one of the worst films of the year so far .  with a title like sw e1 : tpm  lucas has one big head on those shoulders .  i thought chris carter did for releasing an x-files movie  although  that movie adaptation was an excellent way to spend two hours .  pm is one long headache .  , NEGan affluent horse breeders past comes up to haunt him ; an ages old cover-up and blackmail comes back to haunt him at the hands of one of his accomplices .  thats pretty much the essence of the movie and i have to say that it becomes quite boring at times and is very slow .  that aside the story was well presented and probably quite close and representative of its source .  the acting in particular i found very good  the character development was also quite interesting but alas the story simply did not hold my interest enough for me to get into the movie .  a few things about the story didnt sit very well with me for example the original scam and cover-up heavily involved the character played by sharon stone  yet in the end her character played a relatively small role and it seems she should have been utilized more to further the story along better .  on the flip side the character played by catherine keener i found to be very interesting and i thought that it was developed very well and helped the story a lot .  the characters aside this movie had some interesting merits but in the end it lacked in story and pacing .  as far as the acting and casting for this movie is concerned i have to say that the choices of nick nolte and jeff bridges were great as well as that of catherine keener .  all these people acted their parts admirably  as for the part that sharon stone played  she played it well but the part was not utilized enough .  the directing for this movie is something that i have to comment on because for once in a long while you see a director actually add a very distinctive flavor to a movie  this is one of those occasions .  matthew warchus in my opinion added an interesting touch and spin to the movie and i think he tackled a touch subject ( i myself wouldnt be able to look at horseracing and make a movie out of it ) .  there is a certain flavor about this movie and i think that the direction of the movie is the reason for this .  the one flaw that i do have to comment on is the pacing  the subject matter in my opinion wasnt interesting enough on its own to have this kind of flavoring and directorial touch about it .  i certainly hope that the director makes more movies as this does show promise even if i myself dont like it .  all in all i found this movie boring and very slow  the acting was good but the story just didnt evolve enough and wasnt captivating enough to make simpatico an enjoyable movie to watch .  although there is much going for the movie i didnt find it good even though i see the merits and style used and can compliment the movie on them .  i wouldnt recommend this movie to anyone but if you are a horse fanatic or a racing fanatic then you will most likely enjoy this movie .  , NEGa fullyloaded entertainment review : website coming soon !  hunter s . thompsons fear and loathing in las vegas  written in 1971  is already an american classic ; not merely because it was an unadulterated journey through the post-psychedelia of the 1960s  but also because it ushered in a new form of journalism known as  gonzo  .  soon after the book was written  hunter s . thomspon became the basis for a character in doonesbury known as uncle duke .  and that is the problem with fear and loathing in las vegas ( the movie . )  although the book is one of my favorites  i now agree with thompsons own assessment of the novel as  unfilmable .   the main problem is that the book  although detailing wild drug use and tripped-out adventures  was not written on the road .  it was written and edited by hunter s . thomspons  relatively sober  at his home .  so although the book depicts drug use and still more drug use  it is told with a sense of aloofness and some humor .  hunter s . thomspon  the narrator  while always drugged out  still has a grip on reality  and can still tell  with journalistic ability  what is going on around him .  not so with the characters in fear and loathing in las vegas .  despite name changes and one minor scene from the book dropped  the movie is an exact duplicate of the book  in terms of dialouge .  unfortunately  this can get annoying  in the form of johnny depps ( who plays thompson ) excessive narration .  and the characters  while having vivid personalities  are played as 2-d characers on the screen : dr . raoul duke ( johnny depp  the name raoul duke was an alias of thompsons ) and his riding companion  dr . gonzo ( benicio del toro )  who is a large samoan lawyer  have no personalities or emotions at all  save for stoned .  the film is very faithful to the plot ( what there is ) of the book  in that dr . raoul duke is sent by sports illustrated to cover the mint 400  and takes along not only his samoan lawyer but also car trunk full of drugs .  from there  one set of stoned adventures after another happens  including one of the few good scenes in which depp  high on acid  watches all the people in the bar around him turn into  literally  lounge lizards .  while the movie has its moments ( few )  it is almost unwatchable at parts  especially towards the end .  despite a lot of celebrity cameos  the stars never get off the ground .  the set decoration and costumes are great  and probably deserve an oscar nomination .  however  as we all know  its not sets or effects that make a movie  its the characters ; and quite frankly  these characters are no good .  , NEGfilmmakers will use all manner of tricks to flesh out and brighten up a dull  dreary  and overused idea .  doug liman ( swingers )  director of the ultra-hip and severely dark comedy go  is an example of just such a filmmaker .  in his latest  he gives the viewers a raucous  neon-lit backdrop as cinematographer and points the audience down a drug-infested path of misadventure as director .  but he fails to come up with any parallel structure in his multi-tiered movie and he fails to connect with the audience on any level  bringing the worth of his efforts to nil and the value of go to about the same .  his movie is produced anthology-style -- telling the same story from multiple ( three ) points of view  much as an author might write a serial novel .  consistent with this ethic  liman and screenwriter john august provide a bit of an overlap at the beginning of each narrative and insert brief connections to other narratives .  the thread that laces the three stories together is a drug deal and the events thereafter .  in story a we have checkout clerk ronna ( sarah polley ) looking to score some rent money and turning to drug trafficking to do it ; in story b we have regular drug dealer simon ( desmond askew ) gone to las vegas giving ronna her opportunity ; and in story c we have gay soap actors zack ( jay mohr ) and adam ( scott wolf ) working undercover for the police to bust said drug deal .  neither of the three stories have much substance  and the movie has the feel of a campfire story ( albeit a rather strange one ) that could be told in five to ten minutes .   ( in fact  the movie was originally a short film entitled x expanded to feature length . )  the early april release date is too mistimed to capitalize on the movies christmas setting  and the los angeles/las vegas nightlife is something too far from the mainstream for most theater-goers to attach themselves to .  the characters are shallow to the point of prerequisite  and performances from little-known players like polley  askew  and taye diggs dont help or hurt the roles .  in fact  even bigger names like mohr  wolf  and katie holmes dont have enough time to make substantial success .  although thats almost expected for lack of continuous screen time  the success in the picture should come from a thread that binds the stories .  go doesnt have this  and it suffers because of it .  as far as teen movies are concerned  go represents the absolute bottom  for its constant stream of indecipherable light and sound mean nothing without some sort of common theme .   ( the following do not count as common themes : drug deals  people attempting to have romantic interludes with drug dealers  people resorting to drug deals for alterior motives  or people not involved in drug deals stumbling into them . )  at times  the humor in go is sickly funny  and on a low night  almost watchable ; but for the majority of its running time and for most viewers  this movie will best be left to teens at blockbuster on a saturday night .  , NEGi feel sorry for the financial backers of  waterworld   which is supposedly the most expensive film ever made ( at $172 million ! )  and is also one of the stupidest - boy did they get ripped off !  in fact  this film is not really a movie  but more of an amusement park ride with a plot .  its not even just another case of cliches strung together ( well  it is that too )  its something thats painful to watch because it relishes in its flaws .  kevin costner stars as a man who is some kind of mutant half man/half fish .  he is an explorer/mariner on an alternate earth that is completely covered by water because the polar ice caps melted .  hes referred to as the mariner  but they  the meaner  would have been a more appropriate title because hes cold  rigid  and strict - and hes supposed the be the good guy !  he docks at a small floating village of sorts .  he trades dirt for money and this introduces us to the other important characters .  first we meet one of the villains  then the soon-to-be heroine  a child prodigy  a wacky inventor  and a group of primitive people that somehow have some of the technology we have today  but also some of the low-tech tools used by pirates and vikings .  immediately the films biggest flaw is apparent : are these people primitive or highly advanced ?  it doesnt seem like anyone can read yet they have ski-doos and airplanes !  how are these things powered ?  and if they have airplanes  couldnt they just keep flying until they reached dry land ?  also  if the planet is completely covered in water where did they get the materials to make these things ?  im sorry  im all for checking your brain at the door when going to the movies  but elements like these cannot go unnoticed because they draw our attention away from the story and confuse us .  there was potential here for a good pirate story set in medieval times before modern technology  so why mix the two together ?  it doesnt make any sense .  there really isnt much of a plot here because the story moves so quickly it never takes time to explain anything .  the only thing we learn is that the prodigy child  enola ( mojorino )  has a tattoo on her back that is supposedly a map to  dryland .   who put the tattoo there and how come it has taken them this long to figure this out ?  we never get an answer  just a stupid action movie about whoever can get the girl will be the victor of sorts if they reach dryland .  to make a long  boring  stupid  and just plain bad story short ; the mariner escapes with a woman named helen ( tripplehorn ) and enola .  they sail for a long time  encountering some strange people in the process and fight off  the smokers  as lead by the idiot villain deacon ( hopper )  who kidnaps enola .  the story becomes a overly grand adventure with the mariner taking on an army of goons  rescuing enola  and bringing them all to salvation ( how original ) .  even with all its special effects  action  and adventure this film is boring .  not a single character is likable  therefore neither is the plot .  dennis hopper completely rips off jack nicholsons joker  while costner just plain rips .  still   waterworld  is professionally made with a good production design and an original idea but no substance to it .  i just hope they dont make a sequel !  , NEGto watch `battlefield earth is to wallow in misery .  it is one of the most ludicrously conceived efforts in recent history .  it has a clumsily told story  insipid dialogue  shallow characterizations  ugly scene transitions  no evidence of dramatic arc  headache-inducing sound effects  and a resolution that is completely implausible .  worse  theres the promise of a sequel .  why ? !  save your money .  some films go quickly to video .  this one  however  should go straight to the sci-fi channels `mystery science theatre .   in the year 3000  man has become an endangered species .  most of humanity ( called ? man-animals ) was destroyed generations ago in a battle against a race of plundering aliens ( called psychlos ) .  survivors have either taken up shelter in caves or were enslaved to mine earths resources for the rest of their lives .  the aliens are a menacing looking humanoid species that stand nine-feet tall  who resemble inbred klingons .  dimwitted as they are tall  their culture is predicated on power  extortion  and getting ? leverage .   travolta  the leverage-using star  plays terl  the conniving security chief that oversees the mining facility on earth .  much of the movie is spent showing us examples of terls petty machinations .  he routinely employs deception and then punctuates his statements with maniacal laughter .  but one thing is certain ; he hates being stationed on earth .  when the home planet informs him that he will be spending the rest of his life on this planet  he begins to devise his latest plan .  he will select a group of slaves to secretly mine out a gold ore site .  its not clear how this benefits terl  except that it makes him richer in a place where he has no use for it .  the scrappy jonnie goodboy tyler ( barry peppers ) is selected as the slave groups leader .  a psychlo knowledge machine gives him the mining know-how .  but the machine also teaches him other things such as the psychlo language  the principles of our founding fathers  euclidean geometry  and the location of fort knox .  this enlightenment just doesnt prepare him for the mining assignment .  it also prepares him to organize and stage a massive revolt against their captors .  `were going to blow up their home world   he says .  `but first  we need a few more supplies .   in days  he and his comrades evolve from cave dwelling  loincloth wearing  rat eating slaves to fighter pilots and nuclear weapons experts .  by now  the audience is laughing as maniacally as terl .  the media have been working overtime to let the public know that john travoltas labor of love is a piece of sci-fi drivel .  numerous journals have called it an ill-conceived idea stemming from blind hubris  arrogance  and poor planning .  and after watching this movie  youll wholeheartedly agree .  this is a terrible film that is illogically constructed  tediously acted  and frequently begs the question : why was this ever made ?  at a price tag of $90 million  this film will be remembered as a gigantic folly  assuredly becoming `the avengers of this summer .  both films were unforgivable and this promises to suffer the same speedy fate and subsequent indignity .  in addition to the universally pejorative reviews  theres another bizarre element to the `battlefield saga .  this film would never have been made if not for the star power of travolta  who for over a decade  had been trying to persuade studios to bring the story to the big screen .  the controversy is that travolta is a scientologist  and `battlefield is based on a 1982 novel by l . ron hubbard  the religions late founder .  this led some to believe that `battlefield earth would amount to scientologist dogma  laden with subliminal messages .  but the story is so poorly told that any message  subliminal or otherwise  is totally undetectable .  if the audience got anything out of this film  it was this : we are not too unlike the psychlo leader .  like terl  the audience felt imprisoned  dreaded their situation  and looked for any opportunity to leave .  could that be the scientology message ?  , NEG  you cant have any of this .  its all mine !   --- a twisted priest ( charles huevelman ) hordes his tasty fried chicken while dana ( angela zimmerly ) looks on uninterested .  an evil presence  appropriately named the presence ( dj vivona )  rules over an alternate dimension where neither angels nor demons can touch him .  for kicks  the presence likes to trick a human into rounding up five of his or her friends so they can all be sent to his dimension and be systematically slaughtered .  when something goes wrong and one of the presences recent victims escapes  the angels and demons are alerted to his existence and feel he is a threat that needs to be stopped .  they enlist the help of alison ( ramona midgett )  a recent suicide victim  to return to the flesh and follow the six new enlistees through the ice wall that surrounds the the nether-realm .  her mission is to melt away the ice barrier and allow the angels and demons access by reminding the presence of who he once was  an ancient court jester named abraham who lost his job when his king and queen were killed .  the kings sorcerer  amblyn ( who also lost his job )  decided to take abraham under his wing as an apprentice .  during the downtime in his unemployment  amblyn decided to create a new dimension where sorcery  evil  and torture ruled .  abraham wished to follow his master into this new realm  so he was asked to show his devotion to the evil wizard by murdering his one true love .  in this new realm  amblyn would allow abraham to pursue the sport of hunting and destroying the humans that would be brought to this realm .  after each murder  abraham would become stronger  until his power surpassed that of amblyns .  because of the screw-up that allowed the recent escape  abraham was able to destroy his master and take control of the realm himself .  as alison quests to find abraham and show him the errors of his ways  the six new hapless humans are allowed to live out their worst nightmares and then be brutally murdered .  if theres one thing i cant stand when i see a film  its when the film is pretentious and arty just for the sake of being pretentious and arty .  films like eraserhead and begotten are two of the worst examples of this  and now ice from the sun can be added to this list .  this film is essentially an 80 minute stalk-and-slash film ( following the dantes inferno idea that your hell corresponds to how you lived your life or any one of the plots to nightmare on elm street 3 through 6 ) intercut with almost 40 minutes of strange and ( supposedly ) haunting images  many of which serve more to confuse than to further the plot .  if there arent bizarre images floating past the screen  then we get pointless shots of a suicidal alison staring at her breakfast for minutes at a time or contemplating whether or not she should answer her phone .  compelling  but ultimately not .  the opening credits sequence is designed like a music video for some unknown industrial band featuring various random images from the film interspersed with other random images .  the credits run the entire length of the song which is almost five minutes and the actual cast listing and other credit information doesnt pop up until near the end of the sequence .  when the opening credits began i thought my vcr had accidentally cut off and a interstitial from mtv2 had found its way to my tv .  at least the music in the film is pretty decent  made up of mostly industrial and hard rock music and even features a song by ramona midgett .  at the beginning of the film it is established that the presence possesses supernatural powers like shooting bullets out of the palms of his hands and decapitating people by waving his hand in front of them ( and he talks like a darth vader clone without the heavy breathing ) .  for some reason though  he delegates all of his main stalkings to what seems like the supporting cast of deliverance .  one over-alled cretin handles the presences gravedigging and likes to chop peoples heads off with his shovel  then theres an inbred father ( dwight spurgin ) and his two inbred children ( mark kettler and jennifer poirrier-wallace ) that take care of a young woman who has been transformed into a half dog-half human mix with a shotgun  and of course a big truck driving guy that likes to tie people up naked to the back of his vehicle and drag them across stone roads before pouring salt all over their wounds .  why would you want to give responsibilities to a bunch of  rednecks  when you yourself had all of these cool powers ?  and how is it that the fellow that screws over all of his buddies is able to round up exactly five friends to complete the number of people required to enter the realm at exactly the same time ?  i can barely get more than two together all at once at any given moment .  the most ridiculous segment though comes right before the aforementioned dragging/salting sequence .  the character in question  dana ( angela zimmely )  has her turn up to be killed and is standing at the front of a movie theater in which the presence is seated .  a priest holding two naked dirty humans on leashes walks in and sits down next to a large platter of fried chicken .  he picks up the entire platter and starts to enjoy the chicken  taunting dana as she looks on with no interest whatsoever .  when she starts to leave  the priest chides her for going before the performance starts and then something that looks like a either a creature from a gwar show or a terry gilliam animation from monty python come to life  walks out  and makes like it wants to be crucified by her .  the presence starts to clap annoyingly ( which continues for the rest of the sequence ) until dana takes off with the strange creature following her .  when it finally catches up to her  she stabs it in its giant eyeball and is covered in slimy glop that spurts from the ruptured organ .  the box for the film claims  because of the horrifying nature of the motion picture  parental discretion is advised for persons under the age of 18 .  contains nudity and graphic violence  .  while both is certainly true  there doesnt seem to be much of either in any large amounts .  besides a loving close up of a spurting neck stump  a semi-graphic self-surgery scene  and two instances of head trauma ( one run over and one melting )  most of the gore is just of the spraying blood or bloody wound covered body variety .  as for nudity  it is very sparse  but at least we get to see angela zimmerly ( far and away the most attractive cast member ) before her body is bruised  torn  and bloodied by the dragging incident .  ice from the sun has been released on vhs by www . b-movie . com .  it has been presented in in full-frame only and the transfer ( for a film shot a good deal in 8mm ) is pretty decent .  besides the decent soundtrack ( which is also available from www . b-movie . com )  a making-of video is also available called on thin ice .  i havent had the opportunity to see the documentary  but i actually would have been interested to see what the set was like while all of the shots were being filmed  if only to see how director eric stanze ( director of a similar cult film called savage harvest )  conducted the atmosphere on set .  , NEGan 80-year old woman jumps enthusiastically on her couch  wearing tight-fitting leather  as she cheers on her favorite tv wrestler by calling his opponent a `pump-bitch .  two men messily eat fast food as their septic truck leaks raw sewage directly behind them .  and roughly 17 people are booted in the crotch .  welcome to `ready to rumble .  judging from the fact that potty-mouth adam sandler is the reigning box-office comedy champion  you realize -- albeit while shaking your head -- that yes  there is an audience for this sort of thing .  ladies and gentlemen  i weep for society .  mind you  when executed with style and comic ingenuity  jokes like an alarming bodily fluid mistaken for hair gel ( `theres something about mary ) and a laxative-induced attack of explosive diarrhea ( `dumb and dumber ) can be extremely funny .  unfortunately  `ready to rumble is not being helmed by the farrelly brothers  nor is it bolstered by a script that accommodates the viewer with anything even remotely clever or inspired .  `ready to rumble is built around the dedicated fan-base of professional wrestling . . . .  which  in fact  sounded like a fine concept for a goofball comedy .  but director brian robbins and screenwriter steven brill handcuff themselves  and limited to a stampede of asinine  humdrum bathroom humor  basically the only thing they manage is to evoke memories of pauly shore and `bio dome .  gordie boggs ( david arquette ) and sean dawkins ( scott caan ) take pride in being hardcore wcw wrestling fanatics .  by day  they transport raw sewage .  by night ( particularly on ? nitro monday )  they pay homage to their personal hero and savior - jimmy king ( oliver platt )  the undisputed leader of the professional wrestling community .  with two tickets to an upcoming nitro performance  gordie and sean are psyched about witnessing the king defend his title first-hand .  but unscrupulous boxing kingpin titus sinclair ( joe pantoliano  sporting long hair and cowboy boots ) has other plans .  sinclair is plotting to have diamond dallas page ( playing himself ) pummel the king into the tarp  thereby dethroning the dignified wrestler and embarrassing him in front of a bewildered auditorium full of fans .  gordie and sean are shocked  rioting madly while arguing `this isnt even a pay-per view event ! !   they take it upon themselves to track the king down and supply the encouragement essential for their fallen idol to make a come-back attempt .  along the way  you can expect a lot of sh-- jokes as well .  you may find something to like in `ready to rumble if a ) you are a rasslin aficionado yourself  or b ) you are a dedicated fan of the lowest of low-brow comedies .  i welcome low-brow humor with open arms - that is  if its fresh and resourceful .  `rumble is nothing but a sloppy  frightfully unfunny swamp land of misbegotten retardation .  the first half-hour is the ultimate test of patience .  luckily  the simple-minded events pick up steam  particularly with the well-choreographed wrestling action .  director robbins showed a knack for capturing the brutality and excitement of football in `varsity blues  and when in the ring  he does professional work .  but the violence is too excessive .  having the fake soap opera of wcw wrestling turn into a bloody skirmish brings back unfortunate memories of owen harts tragic accident just last year  especially with one characters dive during a cage match .  this is not something you want a comedy to be reminiscent of .  outside the wrestling action  the lewd jokes and puerile sight gags bring new meaning to the term ? scattershot  while the dialogue fluctuates in on the vulgarity scale of 1 to 10  with brills extensive vocabulary ranging from `diddly to `boob and so on .  the final tally : i chuckled a few times  groaned a lot  and indulged in one spirited belly laugh involving martin landau as a geriatric wrestling coach who fights pretty impressively for 105 .  casting-wise  `ready to rumble is an odd duck .  oliver platt as a champion wrestling figure ?  hes perhaps a bit chunky  but fellow wrestlers acknowledge this in the ring by calling him `fatty  which dampens the blow i suppose .  rose mcgowan is fully disposable as a sultry wcw cheerleader ( `the nirto-est of the nitro girls   proclaims gordie )  but extra pep is added with appearances by wrestlers goldberg  `macho man randy savage and sting ( among others ) .  wcw fans are sure to appreciate these .  others . . .  well  wont .  i found merit in david arquettes bountiful energy as gordie  which brings me to my finishing . . . .  ahhh . . . .  `praise for the film : in `ready to rumble  i have discovered something even more annoying than arquettes `at&t television commercials .  now theres a low blow for you .  , NEGits a rare treat when a quality horror film is released in the theater .  and unfortunately with mans best friend  well be waiting a while longer .  the film stars ally sheedy and lance henrikson in a tale of bio-genetics gone wrong .  sheedy plays a nosy reporter whose need for a  good  story provokes her to snoop inside of emax  a poorly guarded million dollar bio-lab that she finds herself effortlessly intruding .  the result : she unleashes the experimental wonder dog named max  a german shepherd with genetic recombination allowing it to swallow like a snake  camouflage like a chameleon  climb trees like a leopard  and attack with the strength of tiger .  max takes a liking to sheedy  and she finds herself protecting the animal from the cruel technological realm of emax  owned by henrikson .  well  it doesnt take long before the hormonally unstable biohazard unleashes his jowls upon the unsuspecting suburban landscape which offers max juicy leg of mailman  etc . . .  sheedy is a boring non-presence on the screen  tripping through the enormous plot chasms neglected by the writer/director ( i apologize for a lack of credits .  i suppose i was eager to leave the theater  and in my rush  forgot to take note of the director  writer  producer  etc . . . ) .  henrikson offered the only relief from the contrived narration of the script  giving his character as much development as he could considering the flat dialogue plaguing the film .  the movie depends upon its ability to impress the audience with animal special effects  but all it presents is a dog that can growl  open door handles with his paw  sit  roll over  play dead  and sick .  the rest of the special effects were so poor  i found them offensive .  the film attains sub-mediocrity  an unambitious film at best .  horror fans might find that cujo offers a better bite .  , NEGjoe versus the volcano is really one of the worse movies made in very recent memory .  the strangest thing is that you would think nothing would go wrong with it .  it has a solid cast with tom hanks & meg ryan as the lead roles .  but you can never judge a movie by its cast . . .  if there is one good thing about joe vs the volcano  it is that the plot is original .  unfortunately  it is also incredibly stupid .  the movie begins with joe ( tom hanks ) going to work .  this opening sequence is very boring and slow .  it shows joe walking to his office .  but on the way  he has to wait in a long line passing by strange and slightly depressing scenery with obnoxious lighting .  a sequence like this should take 2 minutes .  here  it takes over 5 . . .  it is obvious that joe hates his job .  at his office  one of his co-workers is meg ryan .  oddly enough  she plays 3 different roles in this movie ! !  joe leaves to go to a doctors appointment .  his doctor informs him that he has a  brain cloud .   this means that in a few months  he will die .  so what does joe do ?  quit his job  of course ! !  when he arrives home  joe meets an old man named graynamore ( lloyd bridges ) .  graynamore tells joe that in order to get some important mineral for his company from an island  the natives need someone to sacrifice to their volcano to please their fire god .  by a startling coincidence  the boat trip to the island takes a few months .  by the time he reaches the island  he will almost be dead from the  brain cloud  anyway  so joe agrees .  graynamore gives joe a credit card to buy everything he needs to go on this  great adventure  .  joe goes on a date with meg ryan  his co-worker .  the day before the boat trip  joe meets one of graynamores daughters .  she is also  surprise  meg ryan .  except she looks more hippyish .  they both have dinner and the next day  joe gets driven over to his boat .  the lady that sails the boat is another one of graynamores daughters .  and  wonder of wonders  she is also played by meg ryan .  as they sail to the island  meg ryan tells joe that the natives of the island have a craving for orange soda .  after some stupid talking scenes  they also deduce that graynamore had his doctor be the one that joe went to .  and that the  brain cloud  thing was made up ! !  they do plently of cheap special effects on the boat voyage .  joe goes fishing and catches a hammerhead shark .  this is a cheap gag that has been pulled off many times .  but  to top it off  the shark is obviously rubber and fake ! !  one night there is a storm .  a cheap-looking lightning bolt strikes the boat and everything is cast overboard .  fortunately  joe and meg ryan manage to find some of the luggage that joe brought to sail .  by pure luck  they get to the island .  since the natives like orange soda  they wear soda cans as attire ! !  stupid or what ?   ; ) before joe leaps in the volcano  he gets fed .  right before he jumps  meg ryan pleads him not to .  when joe decides to  she goes in with him because  she loves him  .  now this is where the movie should end .  but  unfortunately  the  cheesy ending  bug comes in .  the volcano blows the couple out and into the ocean where they land on joes luggage .  they float to another part of the island as they watch lava pouring out of the volcano towards the villagers .  i give this movie a .  see it only if youre a film buff that enjoys a bad movie every now and then or if you really like tom hanks or meg ryan . . .  , NEG  be gentle   urges natasha henstridge to matthew perry in  the whole nine yards .     i havent made love in five years .     neither have i   rebuts perry .    im married !   if jonathan lynns latest comedy relied simply on jokes of that caliber--and it certainly tries--then itd be an innocuous if rather obvious little film .  instead  its failings go much deeper .  first off  who hasnt had enough of the tough wiseguy intimidates the timid wise guy genre ?  if you want to make a pretty penny or two in hollywood nowadays simply write a  comedy  which pairs a robert de niro/james caan/bruce willis type with a billy crystal/hugh grant/matthew perry type and wait for the royalties to roll in .  whos next ?  jack nicholson and martin short ?  it certainly doesnt have to be funny .    the whole nine yards  is not a particularly funny film  but it is borderline offensive .  offensive in the way it continues a trend of poking fun at career criminals who wouldnt think twice about pushing your mother-in-law off the brooklyn bridge with her feet encased in concrete .  that might sound like a funny sight gag  but the problem is these films have long since lost sight of the fact that taking a human life isnt all that funny to begin with .  when the corpse is placed in a car  doused with gasoline  set ablaze and referred to as  barbecue   it makes you wonder when all this playing killing for laughs is going to end .    the whole nine yards  is also offensive in so much as its three central female characters are portrayed as nothing more than sex objects .  rosanna arquette plays a slutty  chain-smoking french canadian whos married to matthew perrys none-too-successful dentist .  its an unflattering role made all the more so by the unflattering outfits--and unflattering situations--into which arquette is thrust .  then theres natasha henstridge (  species  i and ii ) who plays the well-to-do wife of contract killer bruce willis .  she gets involved with perrys character when he comes to chicago hoping to negotiate a finders fee with mob boss yanni gogolack ( kevin pollack  transposing his vs with his ws ) after willis jimmy the tulip tudeski moves in next door .  henstridge and perrys characters hitting it off is about as likely as bruce and demi getting back together .  perry might have the charm but he doesnt have the physical attributes of a traditional leading man  especially in close-up .  most objectified of the bunch is amanda peet  who turns in a sexually-ripe performance as perrys dental assistant with  it transpires  questionable career goals .  peets gratuitous nude scene proves how low this movie will stoop to keep its audience from dropping off .  when  my cousin vinny  is the highpoint of a directorial career including such forgettable films as  clue    greedy   and  sgt .  bilko   you have to wonder if lynn chose the wrong career path .  perrys pratfalling goofiness coupled with willis likable hardness could have had some potential but with no script to work with  and a director who seems to be watching from the wings  their characters run out of gas quickly .  , NEG  flubber  is the second best example of how to take all the life out of a film remake an adaptation  and hysterically enough both were distributed by disney .  its the kind of film that may be slightly entertaining to tiny kids  but anyone else will feel left out as its boring  slow  and incredibly lifeless .  what could be a film with cinematic magic is instead dead in the water  and its a shame because it could have been a great film .  hypothetically  i mean .    flubber   as you probably know  is a remake of the disney classic i never saw   the absent minded professor   where a  well  absent minded professor played by fred mcmurray created an erratic substance known as  flubber   you know  flying rubber ?  the new one keeps the basic plot  but appears to have added a lot else  like more absent-mindedness on the part of the proffessor  some more villains  and several  show-stopping  moments  like a big rumba with the flubber  and some more elaborate setups  none which really make it any better  but instead make it worse .  the basic plot revolves around a college professor  philip brainerd ( robin williams )  who creates lots and lots of inventions  but is sadly absent minded .  in fact  hes forgotten his wedding to the colleges president  sara jean reynolds ( indie actress marcia gay harden )  two times before he forgets it again at the beginning .  doesnt this warrant some kind of mental treatment ?  anyway  on his wedding day ( the third one )  he invents the flubber  which not only bounces off of everything like a super ball on speed  but can also change shape like the aliens in water form in  the abyss .   philip believes that this invention  once fully realized  will save his college  which is in threat of being shut down by a millionaire tycoon/villain  chester hoenicker ( raymond j . barry )  which is ironically enough the same college his brat son ( will wheaton - thought he was dead ) goes to .  through a plot twist  hoenickers goons  named smith and wesson ( ha ha - what a great sense of humor this film has ) who are played by clancy brown and ted levine ( both who needed the pay check )  discover it the hard way  and try to steal for hoenicker  who wants it just cause hes evil enough .  a sub-plot involves philips attempts to win back sara  whos angry at him ( and with good reason )  but who is being seduced by who is basically philips belloq  wilson croft ( christopher mcdonald  playing the hysterically suave-yet-unsuave asswhole once again ) .  and in another subplot  philips day-timer robot  weebo ( voiced by the one-and-only jodi benson )  falls in love with him .  yuckity-yuck .  whats most pathetic about this film is how dull it is .  you dont need to be a cynical college student to be able to see right through this film  which is another in a long line of cheap attempts at making a quick buck by disney  who have essentially become the puff daddy of the film industry  half-assedly re-mixing classics ( or non-classics ) for distribution to the general public  who sadly eats it all up .  earlier in 97  they released  jungle 2 jungle   an adaptation of a really awful french film   un indien dans la ville   which  yeah  improved over the original  but not by much .  disneys in about as bad shape as warner brothers right now  only creatively .  in the rush to ship out a film for distribution  disney has forgotten to give this film a little thing called  magic .   such scenes as dancing flubber  a flying car  a basketball team that pretty much sucks flying all around thanks to some carefully placed flubber  and an elaborate ending all fail to amaze  delight  or even cause people to laugh .  i sat there the entire film stone faced  chuckling perhaps twice  and shaking my head at all the bad jokes .  who could really laugh at a scene where philip enters the wrong classroom and starts teaching chemistry ?  didnt think so .  it doesnt help that our protagonist is essentially unfunny or even really respectable .  philip is not a lovable absent minded professory  just a really dumb man being played by robin williams .  williams is a brilliant comic actor . . . okay  a brilliant actor in general  but here hes given very little to do but occasionally get hyper over something  and other times act sad .  those times  hes not bad .  but what are we supposed to think of a man whos forgotten his wedding thrice ?  maybe it was funny and/or respectable in the 60s . . .  i like disney  and i usually enjoy their films  not only animated but live action  and their recent films ( save for  hercules   which was good  but not great ) have been worse than lackluster  theyve been pathetic .    jungle 2 jungle  is probably the worst film i saw last year .    flubber  s probably second .  what do they need to do ?  perhaps create something new .  get writers who can write something thats universally entertaining .  films like  the parent trap  and  mary poppins  are films that are live action ( or in the latter case a mix of both )  but even i can still watch them because theyre not only written to be magical to children  but to be fun to adults .  whats more torturous that taking a child to a film that insults you and annoys you at every turn ?  and my god  couldnt they have done something else with edie mcclurg ?  , NEGim going to start this review off with a hypothetical question .  lets say youve just been in a car accident  and the driver of the other vehicle is unconscious .  your friends have left to go get help  and youre waiting to see if the victim wakes up .  a tow-truck comes along  and the driver hops out of the truck to see whats going on .  he then proceeds to kill the unconscious victim by snapping his neck .  do you :  a ) run away screaming for your life  staying away from the main road   b ) run away ( but not too fast ) and stay on the main road even when the madman in the truck starts following you  * stop * to catch your breath  try to negotiate with the psycho  and when that fails  start running away again  all the while * staying on the main road * ?  if you answered  a   you are far more intelligent than the screenwriter of  texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation  and will likely hate this movie .  however  if you answered  b   prepare to enjoy a film made with idiots like you in mind !    texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation  is being called a sequel  but its really more of a remake of the original .  theres a few changes here and there  but its essentially the same ( even the infamous  meathook  scene has been re-created . )  the story opens with four teenagers hitting the road on the night of their prom  and somehow ending up in the middle of nowhere .  needless to say  they soon encounter leatherface and his nutty family .  much carnage ensues .  to call this movie inept would be putting it mildly .  in addition to the laughably idiotic situation i mentioned in my hypothetical question  there is a moment towards the end of the film where one of the baddies is killed by an airplane that literally comes out of nowhere .  it just swoops down and kills him with its wheel .  no explantion is given as to who was flying it or why he/she is going around killing people with the planes wheel .  the dialogue is even more atrocious .  zellwegger  who is kidnapped by  the family  early on  keeps trying to have normal conversations with these people .  when youre surrounded by maniacs wielding chainsaws and dead corpses  i would think that rationality would go out the window .  speaking of going out the window  there is a scene in which zellwegger jumps out a window .  apparently  the stunt double had a little trouble  because she visibly gets stuck in the window .  the director quickly cuts to a wide shot where the stunt double * doesnt * get caught in the window .  this was one of many glaring inconsistencies .  there are so many  in fact  that if i were to name them all  this review would be several pages long .  the only reason i am giving this movie one star instead of no stars is because of matthew mcconaughey .  he plays a member of  the family  with a hydraulic leg ( home-made  i might add ) and is so completely over-the-top  you cant help but be amazed by his performance .  he obviously had a lot of fun with this part  and it really shows .  he makes jack nicholsons portrayal of the psychotic inn keeper in  the shining  look restrained in comparison .  for a horror movie   texas chainsaw massacre : the next generation  contains surprisingly little gore .  in fact  in contains none .  theres a little blood here and there  but thats as far as it goes .  which leads me to believe that the budget must have been * astonishingly * low  and it shows .  everything about the movie looks cheap  from the sets to the costumes .  especially leatherface .  once frightening and nightmare inducing  hes now as terrifying as dame edna .  do yourself a favor and take a pass at this remake .  check out the far superior original instead .  , NEGsusan grangers review of  session 9  ( usa films )  sometimes you just get more than your bargained for . . . like when boston-based hazmat elimination  run by scottish actor peter mullan and his trusty assistant  david caruso  assures a town engineer ( paul guilifoyle ) that they can remove insidious asbestos fibers from a victorian hospital facility in a week .  erected in 1871  deserted and decomposing since 1985  the danvers mental hospital  is one of the most malevolent  locations  ever chosen for a film .  the structure is so massive - with its labyrinth of rubble-strewn corridors  collapsing floors  stagnant pools of water  isolation cells  and ominous surgical chambers where experimental pre-frontal lobotomies were performed - that their task seems impossible within that time frame .  and each member of their inexperienced crew ( stephan gevedon  brandon sexton iii  and josh lucas ) is coping with his own personal demons as  one by one  their minds seem to be affected by the grim areas in which theyre working .  the films title is derived from salvaged reel-to-reel audio-recorded sessions involving the demonic possession of a young woman who is suffering from multiple personalities .  by the time session 9 occurs so do dreadful disasters .  filmmaker brad anderson obviously envisioned this as a gruesome chainsaw-massacre-type ghost story but the script lacks structure and isnt particularly scary .  the conclusion is more ludicrous than convincing .  on the granger movie gauge of 1 to 10   session 9  is a dark  gloomy 4 . silly me . . . at  first  i thought that the original name of the danvers lunatic asylum bore some reference to mrs . danvers  the creepy housekeeper played by judith anderson in alfred hitchcocks truly terrifying  rebecca  that also involved a cavernous mansion called manderley .  , NEGby the time dennis quaid  the ostensible star of switchback  makes his first appearance at about the 22-minute mark  you may find yourself wondering why he bothered .  after all  writer/director jeb stuart has already set up a fairly promising pair of parallel story lines .  the first finds amarillo  texas sheriff buck olmstead ( r . lee ermey ) facing a hotly-contested election battle just as a brutal double homicide is discovered at a motel in his jurisdiction .  as olmstead begins his investigation  we also meet the two men who come to be our prime suspects .  lane dixon ( jared leto ) is an enigmatic young hitchhiker ; bob goodall ( danny glover ) is the jovial motorist who offers lane a ride from texas to his utah destination .  all the necessary conflicts seem to be in place -- the internal struggle of olmstead over the clash between good politics and good police work  and the external struggle as one of the two travelers eventually becomes villain to the others protagonist .  but then quaid shows up as grimly determined fbi agent frank lacrosse .  lacrosse is certain that the amarillo murders are the work of a serial killer he has been tracking for nearly two years .  hes not supposed to be tracking him any more -- according to the bureau  theyve got their man -- but lacrosse has a very important reason for believing otherwise .  two months earlier  lacrosses own son was kidnapped by the killer  and the boy has yet to turn up anywhere .  lacrosse knows his killers work  and he knows that the man is still out there somewhere trying to continue their game .  it wouldnt be fair to reduce everything thats wrong with switchback to quaids presence  but its a pretty good place to start .  theres a reason lacrosse feels like an intruder in the narrative instead of its vital center : as a dramatic actor  dennis quaid possesses exactly one facial expression and one vocal intonation .  we can tell lacrosse is determined because his face is a perpetual tight-jawed  sourpuss pucker ; we can tell hes grim because every word comes out in an eastwood-esque rasp .  a more flexible performer might have given weight to the character  pulling the audience into his haunted intensity  making switchback _his_ film .  quaid merely looks annoyed and slightly constipated .  its tough to become emotionally invested in a characters turmoil when it looks like all he really needs is a big bowl of bran flakes .  even without quaid  it doesnt appear that switchback would have stayed on course .  the early scenes between leto and glover have a lively energy  building our curiosity over which man -- the taciturn kid or his gregarious benefactor -- is the real threat .  unfortunately  stuart tips his hand far too early in the game  both through the pitch of the individual performances and the facts he chooses to reveal .  once the mystery of the killers identity is dispatched  the interaction between leto and glover becomes stale and predictable .  in fact   stale and predictable  describes the direction that switchback takes in general  falling back on far-too-common hollywood devices like cats jumping out of nowhere  a climactic fistfight on board a freight train  and edgy law enforcement agents .  its too bad stuart wasnt willing to spend more time with sheriff olmstead  far and away the most interesting and appealing character in the film .  played with atypical restraint by r . lee ermey  hes a wonderful  unconventional hero who seems genuinely comfortable accepting the consequences of acting on his convictions .  a film focusing on the olmstead would have signaled a film-maker willing to take a few risks with his casting and story-telling .  instead  stuart places his trust in a  name  star who cant carry the material .  maybe next time hell throw away that one crucial page in the script  the one where the grimly determined fbi agent wanders onto the scene to muck up a perfectly good story .  , NEGgregg arakis the doom generation was possibly the very worst film ever made .  so why did i see his latest teen bisexual angst opus ?  first of all  some of the reviews were fairly positive .  also  the cast  consisting of cameos from dozens of washed up ex tv stars ( including christopher knight  eve plumb  shannen doherty  and david leisure ) was promising .  last of all  i wanted to give arraki one more chance .  i mean  the guy cant be that untalented  can he ?  the answer to that question is three letters long .  nowhere follows the character dark on his wild and odd journey through los angeles .  since arraki doesnt know how to make anything coherent  its hard to describe the plot .  lets just say that dark spends the bulk of the movie whining that his girlfriend wont make a commitment to him and jealous because she sleeps around with other guys and girls .  the only remotely compelling storyline involves sarah lassez as a teen who has a chance encounter with a famous tv star .  he turns out to be a nice guy who doesnt care for fame and wishes he could walk down the street without being mobbed by fans .  this story has a shocking twist and a tragic end that i did not see coming .  it is the first time i ever felt any compassion for a character created by arraki  and this can be attributed to the appealing performance of lassez .  i thought maybe arraki was improving in his craft .  he works better with the camera this time around  especially in the early scenes .  halfway through the film  i didnt necessarily find myself enjoying the film  but it seemed like a considerable improvement on the doom generation .  then as the movie went on  arraki loses all sensibility and introduces us to exploding heads  twisted sex games  and alien abductions .  its sad  because he almost actually had some decent material here  but he ruined it with his usual in your face  im such a renegade maverick filmmaker  look what i can do  attitude .  the performances are generally better than in the doom generation  which isnt saying much .  at least we dont have to suffer jonathan  i am the most hideous man in america  schaech .  we are  however treated to another round of james  im more wooden than keanu  duval .  sarah lassez gives the best performance in the film  and kathleen robertson ( formerly of 90210 and now arrakis wife ) and rachel true are talented actresses caught up in this mess .  of the tv star cameos  john ritter is the most interesting as a deranged right wing tv evangelist .  if i prefer nowhere to the doom generation  it is only in the way that i would prefer being assassinated than receive constant physical torture .  maybe greg arraki doesnt want you to like his characters .  maybe he wants to laugh and make fun of those of us who try to care about them .  maybe he just wanted to piss me off .  if so  he was successful .  , NEGsometimes  when i decide to write a short story or a poem  i think of a title first  and then think of a subject to go with it .  it seems that the makers of disturbing behavior had a similar train of thought when it came to the title sequence .  i wouldnt be surprised if a couple of guys got together and created the opening credits  and then someone saw it and made up a story to go along with it .  the title sequence is so good  so ominous and original  that it had me engrossed before the picture even began .  of course  my attention dwindled shortly into the film .  disturbing behavior  like so many thrillers  starts off interesting and ends up laughably ridiculous .  its a teen horror film with no interesting violence or sex .  its a suspense film with no suspense .  its an evil small town story with no story to speak of .  its a disaster  a listless and uninspired disaster  that just barely misses one-stardom because of a few good sequences  a mercifully short running time  and one terrific set of opening credits .  our main man is a fellow named steve clark  blandly played by jimmy marsden .  he moves to a small town with his family after  tragically  his brother shoots himself .  steve is very upset about the untimely death of his brother ; we learn this through strange home-video like nightmares that he has occasionally .  the big trial for steve is  of course  to fit in at school and make new friends .  marsden looks like your stereotypical jock down to the last detail  so he seems a poor casting choice for a social reject .  as a social reject  he falls in with some pretentious dope-smoking philosophers  gavin ( nick stahl ) and rachel ( katie holmes ) .  gavin informs steve that the local group of jocks  known as the blue ribboners  are actually a bunch of zombies  assimilating new members into their group  while sporadically killing innocent people .  so  its up to our group of mismatched protagonists to 1 ) solve the mystery  and 2 ) do something about it .  by the end of it all  something has happened and things have been explained  but the film still doesnt make any sense .  disturbing behavior was written by scott rosenberg .  ive seen his name around recently ( he was one of the toucher-uppers on the armageddon script )  and i imagine that  for the most part  he knows what hes doing when it comes to screenwriting .  he did  however  have a complete lapse in judgement when he got the idea for this film  and then decided to actually take the time to write it out .  evil small town films are pretty common ( the last one  phantoms  is also a dismal failure )  but it takes a lot of skill to make the formula work .  rosenbergs script is a complete mess  lacking in even the most basic attempts at characterization .  and it makes no sense  nor is their any purpose when things are finally  explained .   there is supposed to be an element of surprise when we see what is happening to the jocks  but the film never explains exactly what * is * happening .  they get strapped to chairs  a microchip is inserted into their eyes  and -- poof -- they become sex-crazed  superviolent  machine-like creatures .  the doctor responsible for all this  dr . caldicott ( bruce greenwood )  must be pretty nuts for thinking that this kind of behavior is a step up from the way high school jocks actually behave ( or  perhaps  this is the only realistic element in the film ) .  much of the writing is simply bad  and rosenberg has no intuition when it comes to the way high school kids act .  in one terrible scene  gavin explains to steve all of the high school cliques  while pointing them out in the cafeteria .  up front  i should say that  in four years of high school  i did not eat in the cafeteria even once .  that aside  the various social groups he points out are general  uninteresting  and poorly-shown .  for instance  he points to the  nerds   who are all wearing glasses and playing with their laptops .  its such an obvious cliche that i cant believe rosenberg even bothered .  most of the dialogue is forced ( no one says   bite me !   anymore )  and none of the scenes have any degree of wit .  this picture is not inspired  and most scenes flop from one to the other  with no sense of momentum or energy .  the blame for this can be placed on director david nutter  who apparently likes his films dry .  horror films should at least exploit violence  but this one is shockingly timid .  there are a few good scenes  though  such as an interesting trip through an insane asylum ( this is  however  the most forced scene in the film  for how our heroes get there or why they bother are things we never learn ) .  i also liked the school janitor character  played by william sadler .  he has a few lines that are surprisingly thought-provoking .  the acting is largely a waste of talent .  marsden is  as i said  bland ( thought not particularly bad ) .  bruce greenwood is shamelessly wasted .  stahl and holmes both show they have talent  but the direction isnt good enough to hone in on their skills ( stahls performance seems more like a parody of high school potheads ) .  none of these characters expand beyond their one dimension  and  frankly  watching cardboard cut-outs of human beings run down hallways while screaming just isnt all that cool .  disturbing behavior is a wreck of a film  and it started out a wreck before shooting even began .  im surprised there were producers who read this script and thought that it would make a good film  or that it would make a lot of money at the box office .  its not boring  or even blatantly awful  but its an uninspired lump of a film .  it sure starts off nicely  but the regression into total absurdity is so consistent that the very last scene is outright laughable .  so  if you go to see this film  take my advice : appreciate the credit sequence  and pray it never ends .  , NEGwritten by david j . schow and john shirley  based on the comic book series and comic book strip by james obarr .  cast brandon lee  ernie hudson  michael wincott  david patrick kelly  rochelle davis  and jon polito .  mpaa rating  r  ( presumably for rape  language  and violence )  running time 100 minutes    looks like he zigged when he shouldve zagged .   - ernie hudson  as a police officer commenting on a suspicious death .  comic book translations are notorious tricky-- anyone up for a double-bill of the punisher and captain america ? -- and the crow proves no exception .  despite a gross of good intentions  brandon lees final film doesnt fly very high .  the story opens on halloween eve  better known as devils night .  wilmington-as-detroit is in flames and the police are tending to at least * one * murder : young rock-musician-turned-pavement-artist eric draven ( lee )  found on a sidewalk six-stories below the apartment he was thrown from .  the cops are also upstairs  administering aid to his fiance who was assaulted and raped and not necessarily in that order .  she dies  the perps .  escape  and  exactly one year later  draven rises from the grave to wreak revenge .  sound familiar ?  unlike charles bronson  whose only known superpower involves an inability to refrain from filming death wish sequels  lees character has supernatural strength and amazing agility and can even reheal from gunshot wounds faster than robert patrick in terminator 2 . by his side is his crow  the presumable source of his powers as related in the narration .  wearing what appears to be alice coopers leftover make-up  lee is plopped into an underlit urban landscape that was obviously modeled after batman and blade runner .  but no number of red-lit  rain-soaked streets can compensate for cheap fx that make the crow seem closer to darkman than batman .   ( the glaring miniatures should show better on video  though .   : )  a nod to darkman is an insult to sam raimi  though  because alex proyas cant film a decent action scene to save his life .  his two  best  set-pieces-- some banzai board-room butchery and a cool church- roof sword fight-- are also undercut by the awful editing of dov hoenig and scott smith .  blame said editors for the films frightful flashbacks  as well .  but the pace is quick  thank god  and every good-idea-turned-bad is over before it begins .  the cast is better than it should be .  ernie hudson is a good choice as a friendly policeman and he gets off most of the films funnier lines .  newcomer rochelle davis does well as both the narrator and dravens scrappy ward .  jon polito has a small  succulent role as pungent pawnbroker .  and michael wincott makes a distinct impression as a long-haired mr . big whose collection of ancient-swords makes him seem like he walked into the film from the trailer to highlander iii .  there can be only one .  finally  theres brandon lee  son of bruce lee  and a 28-year-old rising-star who was fatally shot during shooting .  lee had four films to his name-- kung fu : the movie  laser mission  showdown in little toyko  and rapid fire-- and the crow wouldve been a nice feather in his belt and thats about it .  theres nothing great from him here-- just a good performance that owes as much to presence as ability .  when the echo of that gunshot finally fades  watching the crow should prove an even * less * remarkable experience .  despite a healthy dose of humor and some surprising sincerity  the crow is still just a couple notches above its straight-to-video brethren .  for now  maybe its an appropriate eulogy to an actor who could only get better .  ,

bahamas .  arriving at the start of the hurricane season  julie and karla run around in very tight clothing and realize theyve walked into a trap set by the rainslickered slasher with a huge hook for a hand .  comments : i may be showing some pop culture illiteracy here  but i have never seen an episode of the fox tv series  party of five .   i am only vaguely aware of the shows premise  and my knowledge of it comes from brief commercials i half-paid attention to while watching the tube .    party of five   i do know however  seems to be the starting ground for actresses in the teen horror genre .  neve campbell  scream queen of the 90s and star of scream  scream 2  and the craft  is a regular of the show .  so too is jennifer love hewitt .  lo and behold  following in the footsteps of campbell  hewitt now has a horror franchise of her own : the i know what you did last summer line .  though the original film  released last year  was watchable enough  this insipid sequel had me looking at the theaters glowing red exit sign longingly throughout .  jennifer love hewitt is a very good-looking young leading lady ; however  unlike neve campbell  hewitt struggles with acting .  she just isnt convincing in this film ( and she wasnt in the original either ) .  this puts many young males  including myself  in a paradoxical quandary : shes very attractive  but the annoying  spoiled  valley girl-type character she tries to play here is annoying to the extreme and ruins many of the scenes which emphasize  exploitatively  her figure .  add to the mix the equally pleasant yet irritating brandy  another rising teen tv star  and you get one frustrated male audience .  ive spent so much time on hewitt and brandy for a reason .  i still know what you did last summer  though cashing in on the success of the original  ultimately serves as a vehicle for these two young actresses .  nothing else here is original or interesting .  this movie  in fact  makes other recent so-so horror films like urban legend and john carpenters vampires seem like stunning works of high art .  i still know relies heavily on tired slasher film cliches : an isolated location  a storm  parentless teenagers  false alarm nightmares  lots of blue-lighted darkness scenes  a garbed slasher who walks around in the background without the characters seeing him  knives and other sharp instruments lying around everywhere  etc . you get the picture .  the entire audience knows all the secondary characters introduced in the film are going to receive the business end of the killers hook .  they may as well have huge targets painted on them .  like scream and its numerous knockoffs  these secondary characters are supposed to serve as comic relief .  unfortunately  i still knows characters arent all that funny .  in particular  one character  a chain-weed-smoking guy  is obnoxiously annoying and certainly doesnt die soon enough .  the death scenes  by the way  are relatively violent for a theatrically released horror film .  several of them are uncomfortable to watch  and they reminded me of the sickening gore scenes in hellraiser : bloodline  a truly sadistic movie .  this  too  did not help the supposed humor i still know was shooting for .  and what is the deal with the slasher himself ?  i know that the slasher film is not a particularly intelligent genre  but ben willis has got to go down as one of the most silly slashers in mainstream horror .  come on  the guy looks like the gortons fisherman  and his gruff voice makes him sound like a disney pirate .  though his lightning-lit appearances ellicited much-needed laughter in the theater  his appearance borders on the absurd in the horror film  and thats * really * saying something .  so  all thats left to talk about here is jennifer love hewitt and brandy .  both prance about in tightfitting  revealing outfits or in various states of undress  yet neither of them ever actually do a nude scene .  hewitt  however  does do a post-shower scene in which her thin bathrobe is quite .   .   . titillating .  this scene alone made this one-star turkey earn two stars under my rating system .  otherwise  hewitt and brandy both grate on the nerves .  early in the film  for instance  brandy wins the trip to the bahamas .  she and hewitt jump around and scream and screech for what seems like forever .  i needed extra-strength tylenol after that part .  oh  and the films conclusion  talk about repetitive !  people who saw i know what you did last summer will predict i still knows ending at least 5 minutes before it happens .  boring !  i saw this movie with my brother at the local downtown movie theater .  admission is only one dollar on wednesdays  and we often go see bad movies on these days just to ridicule them .  its usually a fun thing to do along with the rest of the audience  who dont seem to mind participating in a mass  mystery science theater 3000  -type viewing .  i still know what you did last summer  however  produced several lengthy uncomfortable silences from the audience  underscoring how bad it * really * is .  if it werent for the main actresses revealing wardrobes  id have had a very  very hard time sitting through this lame sequel .  i cant imagine trying to watch it on video ( horror films seem 10 times better in a theater because they rely heavily on audience participation ) and wouldnt recommend it to people  unless theyre horror film fanatics or huge fans of hewitt and brandy .  i read on a website somewhere that another sequel is already in the works .  what a depressing thought .  hewitt apparently needs to spend more time on tv figuring out how to act .  rated r  this film contains lots of violence  several gory scenes  and a couple nubile  horny teenagers--though the sex act itself is always thwarted .  id say this is unsuitable for kids  but teens wouldnt have a problem sitting through it  especially since they obviously compose the films target audience .  , NEGnote : some may consider portions of the following text to be spoilers .  be forewarned .  to assess alex coxs film the winner as a loser would be so indolent .  it would be derisive .  it would be glib .  it would be dismissive .  it would be entirely accurate .  rarely have i seen a film as excruciatingly annoying as the winner  a would-be comedy which quickly proves to be tedious  unfunny  and unengaging .  the film attempts to be fresh and quirky  utilising a myriad of colourful characters to weave its absurd tale  but appears to overlook the fact that nobody in the film is remotely interesting and that all of the characters are essentially preposterous .  the film is set in las vegas  and the focus in the winner is on philip ( vincent donofrio )  an aloof  naive young man blessed with the odd gift of luck ; he virtually cannot lose at the tables .  despite this prodigious talent  philip is perpetually mournful and quite indifferent about his gambling fortunes  neither taking joy in his winnings nor having the foresight to mask his abilities .  consequently  he becomes an easy target for those who would ride upon his coattails and take advantage of his talent .  louise ( rebecca demornay )  a sultry lounge singer  insinuates herself into philips life for the purpose of swindling him  while philips estranged brother ( and  conveniently  louises ex-beau ) johnny ( michael madsen ) arrives on the scene .   ( to add some colour  johnny also happens to be toting their fathers corpse  sans one hand . )  meanwhile  philip is also befriended by a trio of low-rent  opportunists ( frank whaley  billy bob thornton  and richard edson )  who have every intention of taking advantage of their new buddys gift with the dice .  serenely overlooking the chaos from behind the scenes is the casino owner ( delroy lindo ) ; it is probably not giving away much to reveal that his role in the winner is essentially that alluded to at the end of the flashy sequence in martin scorseses casino which details the organization hierarchy of a casinos operations - he * is * the eye in the sky .  it could be maddening to endure a film whose central protagonist is so oblivious of the ongoing blatant manipulation  but fortunately this is not the case in the winner  if only because our sadsack hero is such a sap ; not even remotely sympathetic or compelling  it becomes impossible to root for philip or even care about his fate  and the would-be swindlers of philips fortunes are all drawn out as such ludicrous  transparent buffoons with entirely unimaginative and uninteresting schemes that one watches the winner with a complete sense of disinterest .  it is a shame  as the winner features a talented cast - mr . donofrio is an underrated and gifted actor with a huge range ; mr . lindo has a remarkable screen presence which infiltrates every film in which he appears ; mr . madsen  ms . demornay  and mr . whaley have all done good work in the past .  none of the actors in the winner are in top form here  and this film wont likely be a prized addition to their respective resumes .  director alex cox does what he can with wendy riss screenplay  and it is to his credit that this film at no point feels like an adaptation of a stage play ; i was startled to learn that the winner was in fact based upon one .  while tedious  the film is well-paced and does not meander  but it would be near-impossible task for mr . cox ( or  for that matter  virtually any other director that comes to mind ) to overcome the films widespread shortcomings in plot and characterization .  to his credit  my understanding is that he has chosen to distance himself from the project in acknowledgement of its deficiencies .  i caught the winner at its world premiere at the toronto international film festival in september 1996  and in fairness it is entirely possible that the film has been extensively revamped since then due to the lacklustre audience reaction generated - there were more walkouts on this film than any of the others i screened .  to be honest  though  i couldnt begin to isolate what could be done to this film to improve it - i assume that throwing the whole thing out and starting over is out of the question .  the winner has apparently played on cable television in the united states and is beginning a limited theatrical release at the time of this writing .  the film has a nice upbeat score by pray for rain  but i am honestly not being facetious when i state that the thing i treasured most about my screening of the winner was the bag of popcorn upon which i was munching .  , NEGwhats to like about the world of extremely violent trash pornography--ie .  the garbage known as  snuff  films ?  nothing  right ?  whats to like about a film chronicling the world of violent trash pornography ?  well . . . nothing .  so  why make it  hollywood ?  theres no reason why the average  sane movie-goer will be interested in such a topic .  no one is going to enrich their life or have a good time by watching material such as this .  the lack of quality filmmaking in  8mm  ( from technical to acting ) stands out even more when you consider the star  writer  and supporting cast--all reputable .  but joel schumacher and his brand of unlikable filmmaking strikes again !  like paul schrader  schumacher has his moments  but theyre few and far ( far ! )  between .  basically  this picture is crap and no one should pay to see it .  why not walk out ?  well  this wouldnt be a thorough review about a thoroughly bad movie .  heres why you should spend your money on dog food or gum instead of  8mm  . . .  first thing--if you dont heed my advice  then understand what youre about to see before you even think about paying good money for this crud .  its not easy to watch .  i didnt know the details of the story beforehand  but at least my ignorance can help others now .  the ( ha ! ) plot revolves around tom welles ( nicolas cage ) as a surveillance expert and private investigator .  a rich old woman discovers a  snuff  film in her late husbands safe .  she calls welles and hires him to try and find out if the young girl ( it had to be a young girl  didnt it  schumacher ! ) who appears to be murdered in the film really is dead .  shes horrified that her husband would have owned such a film ( in 8mm  of course ) and just wants welles to snoop around without police interference to see what he can find .  family-man welles agrees against better judgement or any concrete leads even after cringing and grimacing at the sight of the grotesque  murder  .  let me backtrack for a moment .  see   snuff  films are pornos with a violent twist--people are tortured in very sick ways and end up dead .  however  the deaths are often staged and  in those cases  special effects and  good  acting make all the difference .  very sick people enjoy and pay top dollar for these hard-to-find movies .  the thought of this  industry  makes me want to throw my computer out the window and stop this review  but ill swallow my bile and move on .  welles follows clues to hollywood and the porn industry .  youd think hes sherlock holmes the way clues drop so easily for him !  he comes across smut clerk max ( joaquin phoenix ) who knows everyone and everything in the underground business of sleaze .  after a lot of digging and bribing  welles finds the men who are responsible for making this  and other   snuff  films .  skip ahead  skip ahead  skip ahead . . .  led by dino velvet ( peter stormare in an uncharacteristically terrible performance ) and star-torturer  machine  ( christopher bauer )  they have a big showdown with welles where death and mayhem ensue .  the movie doesnt end there  unfortunately  because welles has to do what all heroes in schumacher films do--become a vigilante .  this film doesnt draw you in .  it keeps you about 700 miles away from it and who in their right mind would want to get close ?  it is possible to like a film that focuses on grime and sick behaviour ( ie .    se7en  )  but it takes a large measure of restraint ( schumacher has none ) and a larger amount of talent ( schumacher has little ) .  by those jabs  im not only referring to his stylish destruction of the  batman  franchise  but  a time to kill  was an immensely overrated disappointment .  for a guy who gets so much studio money  his track record of making rather bad movies is unparalleled .  a good screenwriter and a good director can make you hypnotically watch even disgusting subject matter .  writer andrew kevin walker didnt recapture the smarts of the fascinating script he authored for 95s twisted thriller   se7en  .  director schumacher doesnt have that innate ability to make you watch things you dont really want to see like better directors are capable of doing .  he must not have believed hitchcock who espoused the theory that what we dont see is more frightening than what we do ( especially when its a scene where young girl is supposed to be murdered ) .  however  gratuitous is joels middle name .  he must think that not flaunting a hard-core act of violent sex is showing plenty of tactful restraint .  no  he doesnt go that far  but we see enough unpleasantness .  he doesnt leave much to the imagination .  its manipulating to hurt ( or kill ) young girls just to get the audience on the side of a murderous vigilante .  the script and acting should be what gets us to believe in these characters  yet schumacher has no subtlety in his ( ha ha ! )  craft .  case in point  a shot of a christian fellowship bus ( good  right ? )  drives away to reveal one of the villains ( bad  right ? ) .  see . . . no  subtlety .  does joel think were stupid or that we need to be held by the hand to comprehend the contrasting imagery ?  who do we root for in this mess ?  is there anybody out there ?  its not all the directors fault  though .  why did the actors sign up for this ?  nicolas cage is an oscar-winner  for cryin out loud !  if he claims to do films to challenge himself and for the artistic merit rather than the money  what was he smoking when this script dropped on his veranda ?  what is cage supposed to be in this movie--a whispering batman without the charisma and pointed ears ?  villainous peter stormare is five steps past hammy .  and what is james gandolfini doing in this trash ?  he was so solid as a concerned father in  a civil action  .  i guess ol nic  pete  and jim were promised a mountain of money . . . or  theyre suckers .  or they just dont care .  there are moments ( albeit brief ones ) where this rises above the wasteland .  catherine keener is good ( although too quick to threaten divorce ) as mrs . wells .  baby cindy is obviously cute and wells devout love of his daughter is sweet .  the mother ( amy norton ) of the girl in the infamous 8mm film is not too bad as a woman dealing with the uncertain loss of her runaway daughter .  this film has an appropriate blue-toned  washed-out look like  payback  ( which was a much better movie ) .  the editing is okay in scenes of no dialogue  but at other times its rough .  during some conversations  close-ups and wide shots are not cut very well  making it look to be editted by someone whose instincts arent good and whose timing was a half-second off .  such a technical error indeed stands out .  speaking of standing out  dont believe the misleading trailers .  theres not much action here .  occasionally  yes  but not as often as your tv will have you believe .  after seeing  8mm   i may not be interested in ever watching any kind of porn again .  is that a positive ?  well  if making me almost ill at the thought of glimpsing a dirty movie again is their motive  theyve done a swell job here .  itll be a long time before i give a schumacher film another chance--unless i lose my mind and become seriously depraved .  but today im not depraved  so i ask  why does this film preach that this garbage is out there and that society should be worried about it ?  im sure that somewhere right now theres some pretty sick crap going on  but that doesnt mean i need to know about it .  yes  mr . walker  your script tells us that there are some screwed-up folks out there .  yes  mr . walker  the proverbial monster doesnt look like we expect him to .  you said all that in 1995 .  move on .  this film serves no purpose .  it doesnt entertain  it doesnt teach us anything  it doesnt make a statement beyond the obvious  this stuff is bad  approach .  only if this film awakens the authorities to find a way to abolish these types of horrors would it ever do someting truly worthwhile .  thats not likely to happen  though  so  8mm  is indeed a scummy waste of money .  orson welles said years ago in a tribute to film   to movies . . . to  good movies  .  if only joel schumacher and the producers had listened and told andrew kevin walker to bury this crud deep in a hole .  like  snuff  films   8mm  should never have been made .  now  excuse me while i go try to forget i ever saw it .  useless trivia--joel schumacher loves the vigilante theme .  he used it in  batman forever   in  batman & robin   in  a time to kill   in  falling down   and its rumoured that joel himself will play the vigilante at his breakfast table tomorrow . . .  , NEGin the james bond film  diamonds are forever   tiffany case asks 007 whether he prefers brunettes to redheads .  bonds response is that it doesnt really matter  as long as collars and cuffs match .  well  collars and cuffs dont match in  the real blonde .   what might have sounded good on paper ends up as a largely unfunny  meandering comedy on screen .  the film  supposedly a satire of the superficiality of soap operas and the modeling business  is wafer thin .  it plays like an  ally mcbeal  episode dragged out to the nth degree  replete with a few unnecessary  fantasy  sequences .  writer/director tom dicillo manages the material as if poking fun at daytime dramas is a fresh idea .  it isnt .  the only surprise here is that the talented dicillo could make familiar terrain so dreary .  matthew modine plays joe  a struggling actor waiting tables in order to pay the rent .  hes 35 with no agent and no credits since hes too proud to take on roles in commercials or soap operas .    thats not really acting  he tells his girlfriend of six years  mary ( catherine keener )  with whom he bickers constantly about sex .  but they need the money  so joe finally agrees to take a part in a madonna video .  but its not really madonna starring in the video but a lookalike ( played by elizabeth berkley  still trying to jump-start her career after  showgirls  ) .  this points out how artificial this whole business is  one supposes .  dicillo has referred to  the real blonde  as  off-kilter  but an interesting combination of all sorts of stuff . . .   the film  which wanders all over the place without getting anywhere  is remarkably * on * -kilter and  with perhaps the single exception of the always-likable modine ( whos not afraid to stand around in a very unattractive bathing suit surrounded by hunks )  the entire cast is vague and uninteresting .  catherine keener  whos appeared in dicillos previous three films ( including the brilliant  living in oblivion  )  is at her most annoying in  the real blonde .   look at her closely ; she really cant act at all .  her reactions are all wrong  almost always out of sync with her co-stars .  she reacts too soon  or too late  to lines and situations .  she moves her eyes  or her mouth  far too much .  she frowns  she yells  she babbles--she blows chunks .  maxwell caulfield plays joes actor/waiter buddy bob  the one obsessed with dating a  natural  blonde .  bobs personality ( not to mention caulfields acting ability ) parallels that of the character he plays on the soap opera  passion crest  --stiff and uninteresting .  maybe thats the point .  daryl hannah is dim and uninteresting as the real blonde of the title  a soap dish who beds bob both on- and off-camera .  hannah looks about fifty in this movie ( shes only 37 ) .  why is that ?  almost all the women in the film wear tops that show their nipples .  why is that ! ?  marlo thomas plays an uninteresting fashion photographer .  kathleen turner plays an uninteresting talent agent .  buck henry plays an uninteresting shrink .  christopher lloyd plays an uninteresting caterer .  and so on .  the best parts of the  the real blonde  are the beginning and the end  brief scenes of an elderly woman losing and then finding her dog .  theres more depth and sincerity in a single close-up of her expressive face than in the entire film .  while this contrast is supposedly meant to highlight the shallowness of the other characters lives  the only thing that makes shallow and superficial interesting is if its funny .  , NEGif i were to plot a graph of year against movie-plot-ridiculity for = hollywood movies  youll probably see a line with constant gradient .  = now  if i were to plot that same graph for the movies that the michael = bay/jerry bruckheimer has made over the last 4 years  that line would be = exponential in growth .  the team started out with the will smith vehicle = bad boys which was no more than a 2hr long action-music-video  = nevertheless entertaining .  then came the rock  where audiences flocked = to see nicholas cage team up with sean connery against some terrorizing = general fighting over some stupid cause .  con-air was ridiculousy dumb in = its premise but it did have fun moments  and who can forget the nursery = rhyme sang by that psycho killer played by steve buscemi .  while these = movies worked because there was something better to cover-up the dirt  = armageddon does not .  very much like deep impact  a meteor is heading towards earth and they = didnt realize it until 18 days from impact .  deep impact settled with = the modest meteor size as large as the city of new york but armageddon = just had to be bigger . . . . well  about the size of texas ( that kinda meteor = whould probably knock earth out of its orbit ! ) .  the panic of this = sighting spurs the idea of landing people on the meteor  drill it then = nuke it ( sounds familiar ) and who better to do such a job than harry = stamper ( bruce willis )  your very own oil-driller extraordinaire and = his team of macho-misfits  nursing the tagline `there aint nothin on = this planet that harry cant drill !  .  in that 18 days  harrys group was = split into 2 teams  trained for deep-space flight and finally blasted = into space in with special drilling vehicles on 2 new space shuttles .  the main relationship drama of armageddon is formed within the = relationship of harry  a . j .  and grace .  to give you an idea  a . j .  works = for harry  and loves grace  harrys daughter .  the problem is  harry = hates to see his daughter hanging around some scruffy grunt like himself = for the rest of her life .  so while a . j .  and harry struts it out  grace = is place in a position where she is unable to take sides  so she remains = seated in the nasa control tower  crying over both of them in about 80% = of the movie .  the human elements this movie tries to inject proves to be nothing more = than just an excuse for more slow-mos and gold-tinted photography .  the = anguish of the world is potrayed with scenes of people praying  running = for their lives or just sitting still staring at the sky  sounds fine = right ?

 this time she gives her daughter a horrible beating while delivering another classic outburst :  no . . . wire . . . hangers . . . . ever ! ! ! !  .  and later  when the board of her late husbands company pepsi cola tries to divest her of her directorship  she displays a superb grasp of business etiquette by jumping to her feet and roaring :  dont fuck with me  fellas ! !  .  oh joy !  something of a camp classic  then  but if thats not youre cup of tea then mommie dearest doesnt have too much to recommend it .  better you see the real crawford in the women ( 1939 )  mildred pierce ( 1945 ) or whatever happened to baby jane ( 1962 ) .  great films distinguished by great performances  and a far more eloquent testament to this great woman than frank perrys shrieking piece of tabloid froth .  , NEGphil ( radmar jao ) has a hairy problem .  his beard is growing so rapidly that he has to shave every hour .  he recently met the author of a non-fiction book on lycanthropy  also referred to in the movie as werewolfism  and phil now believes that his problem is that he has become a werewolf .  using enough chains and handcuffs to be a hit at a sadomasochists convention  he ties himself in at night lest his urges overcome him .  and phil is just one of the many quirky characters that inhabit shopping for fangs .  made on a pittance  the film features an almost exclusively asian-american cast .  as directed by quentin lee and justin lin  the movie is so amateurishly bad that it could almost be a parody of indie films .  jeanne chin plays katherine  a meek and soft-spoken wife  who worries that her husband is unhappy with her because she is not giving him enough sex .  we know this through the endless scenes of her confessing her sins  real and imagined  to her therapist .  as her husband  jim  clint jung plays a muscle man with a macho crudeness .  the picture is filled with stereotypes .  theres a mysterious  loud-mouthed waitress with a big  platinum blonde wig who brags to everyone she meets that shes a lesbian .  she spends most of the movie putting the moves on her favorite customer  a gay guy .  and the lone white with a major role  the author on werewolfism  has wildly unkempt  orangey blonde  curly hair .  from its opening scene of an attempted rape at knifepoint to its easy to guess ending twist  the script rarely has anything to offer .  the story is so minimally developed that it feels almost like the actors were ad-libbing .  one can only hope that the directors next film will have some substance and some credible acting .  shopping for fangs runs 1 : 30 .  it is rated r for sex  violence  and profanity and would be fine for older teenagers .  , NEGwriter/director lawrence kasdan had a hand in penning some of the biggest film successes of the 1980s .  yes  thats right  he co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 )  the empire strikes back ( 8 . 5/10 ) and return of the jedi ( 8/10 ) .  now with this film  it looks as though he has decided to test his skills at mediocre screenwriting and bland directing .  and guess what ?  he succeeds once again !  plot : a man with a shady and regrettable past decides to run away and into a small american town  where he pretends to be a licensed psychologist to an open-armed swarm of people with problems .  it isnt long before he befriends the small-town billionaire  folks become suspicious and he falls for one of his own patients .  critique : this film is not a comedy !  it is a drama .  i say this right up front because from the looks of the trailer  you would think that this film secures its base in humor  but unfortunately for us  it does not .  it is a serious film ( seriously flawed if you ask me  but i digress ) which offers a couple of witty quips to keep you awake  but overall  just sits there .  now on to my review .  this movie sucks because it was slow and boring  starred an uninteresting protagonist with an unbelievable past  included extremely dull patients whose problems left me indifferent at best and pissed at worst  and certified it all with many a predictable ending .  i have no idea what lawrence kasdan was trying to accomplish with this picture  but whatever it was . . . he  missed !  anyone without his name could never have made this film because it is an extremely generic puff-piece  which on a good day  might be described as predictably digestible .  its no wonder that the studio is trying to sell it as a comedy !  it sucks as a drama  and bored my movie cohort right to sleep .  ive given it four points on four extremely shallow yet distinguishable marks .  first of all  i couldnt help but think about how much the lead actor  loren dean  looked like a young charles grodin .  he even acted like him  save for the dry  sardonic wit .  this kept me interested in watching him at least .  number two  and this one is really shallow ( seemed to be geared that way as well )  there were quite a few  titshots   as they would say back in high school .  and god help me if i cant get enough of those in an aimless drama .  and three  and this one surprised me the most  actor ted dansons cameo ( yes  he will always be sam malone to us real fans ! ) was the best part about this movie and actually made me see him as a different person .  a different asshole  but a different person nonetheless .  if ever you rent this movie one day ( promise you wont throw away your hard-earned money at the theaters ? ! )   wait for his scene because its actually pretty good .  other than that  drab  drab  drab and drab .  even jason lee  a personal favorite of mine  was left out to dry with lame dialogue and one of the phoniest romances to hit the big screen in a while .  well  at least he finally  came out  and did some real skateboarding in this movie !  oh yeah  and i guess thats the fourth point in my rating .  anyway  if you enjoy watching boring patients babble on about their boring problems to an uninteresting psychologist . . . this  films your bag !  otherwise  skip it and see analyze this ( 8/10 ) again . . . now  theres a great shrink movie !  little known facts about this film and its stars :  threes company  fans alert ! ! !  terri from the tv show  also known as actress priscilla barnes  plays a small but pivotal part as the landlady in this film .  the scene is actually a fantasy sequence and does feature cleavage  so stay tuned  kids !  also  it is to note that the actress was once named  penthouse pet of the month  in march of 1976 .  she was known as one joann witty back then .  shes originally from jersey .  who the hell is loren dean  the dude who plays mumford in this film ?  you got me  but all i know is that he was born in las vegas in 1969 and played the character of billy bathgate in the 1991 film of the same name .  jason lee was born in the state of california in the year of 1971 .  he was a professional skateboarder before his acting career took off after mallrats ( 6/10 )  and even owns his own skateboarding company called stereo manufacturing corp . hes been in every kevin smith film except for clerks ( 8 . 5/10 ) .  listen closely and you will hear the pharmacist in this film ( the ballooning actor formerly known as pruit taylor vince ) make a reference to the  lost ark   which is obviously an in-joke  considering that it is the writer/director of this film  lawrence kasdan  who co-wrote raiders of the lost ark ( 9/10 ) .  kasdan also played the part of dr . green in 1997s as good as it gets ( 8/10 ) .  ted danson also played the role of lawyer peter lowenstein in kasdans 1981 directorial debut body heat starring a sexy kathleen turner and william hurt .  , NEGladies and gentlemen  payback is the most expensive episode of  the equalizer  ive ever seen .  gibson plays porter  a burglar shot and left for dead by his wife ( deborah kara unger  in an all-too-brief cameo ) and partner ( henry ) after a successful heist .  as a morgue attendant sets about removing the bullets from porters back  porter miraculously springs back to life .  he makes it his mission  as a walking dead man without a conscience  to exact revenge on those who screwed him and reclaim his share of the loot .   ( in a running gag  porter demands $70 000  but everybody mishears him and assumes hes after the entire $130 000 haul . )  in his travels ( or travails )  porter encounters several other one-named villainous cretins like fairfax ( james coburn as a white-haired  millionaire thief ) and carter ( kristofferson  as a brown-haired  millionaire thief-the kingpin of the obligatory  operation  ) .  helgelands film ( which was recut by mel the producer ) is devoid of an imperative dime store charm .  the novelty of seeing a big movie star mercilessly dispatching criminals wears off quickly : a ) because the bad guys can only be differentiated by their coifs  and b ) because mels schtick doesnt evolve from act one-hes the terminator stranded in a plot without a sci-fi hook to keep us interested after the initial sadistic thrill is gone .  payback should have been called playback : its a 102-minute loop of the same short sequence .   ( mel :  i want my money .   anonymous villain :  no .   mel shoots gun .  anonymous villain dies .  mel meets up with his hooker friend ( bello ) .  second verse  same as the first . )  its not porters single-mindedness that robs the film of snap  crackle  and pop ; as a character who has already  died  once  he has nothing to lose and so much to gain .  the movie lacks danger .  the only thing porter is in jeopardy of is putting the audience to sleep .  payback has a gritty  metallic look to it that also becomes monotonous ; its cinematography would be more appropriate in one of those bleak urban psychodramas that come out of england every couple of months .   ( director of photography ericson core should have been fired early on for lighting bello  so va-va-va-voom in permanant midnight  to look like a potato in a gregg allman wig . )  to analyze such mediocrity is to grant payback far more attention than it deserves .  perhaps only someone as experienced with antagonists-as-protagonists as tarantino-look what he did with the similar hero-less botched-robbery tale reservoir dogs-could have pulled off this material ( a loose remake of john boormans point blank ) .  the movie presents us with the conventions of pulp fiction ( all women are femme fatales ; even the cops are in on it  etc . ) and crosses them with the conventions of cheesy tv crime melodramas ( death is never in the cards for the main character  etc . ) but transcends neither .  , NEGwhen youve run out of old tv shows to turn into movies  i guess you try video games .  why did i go to see mortal kombat : annihilation ?  the quest to seek an answer to this query may prove a better movie that the one i just saw .  this film was a bunch of fighting  yelling  special effects  and bad acting set to an oppressive techno music soundtrack .  the plot is fairly simple : a portal has opened between our world and the  outworld   allowing evil forces commanded by shao kahn ( brian thompson ) to wreak havoc and attempt to destroy humanity .  the good guys  led by sorcerer rayden ( james remar ) and human mortal liu kang ( robin shou )  must take the fight to outworld  where the fate of both worlds will be determined .  heres the catch : they must reunite princess katana ( talia soto )  whos on the good side  with her resurrected mother queen sindel ( musetta vander )  whos on the bad side  for their love for each other will close the portal and ensure humanitys safety for another generation .  how this is supposed to work  i still have no idea  but i liked katanas line   i knew love would keep us together   since that captain and tennille song ran through my head and i got a good laugh .  there are some seriously stupid things in this movie .  take  for example  a transportation system which utilizes the  inner winds   generated by earths magma flows .  you get in this metal ball which transports you through underground tunnels really fast .  how fast ?  as katana says   you will be moving so fast  it will be as if you are not moving at all .   what ?  later  sonya blade ( sandra hess ) goes to find jax ( lynn  red  williams  otherwise known as  saber  on tvs american gladiators ) at a medical research facility on the island of oahu .  how do we know this is where she went ?  theres a sign on the facilitys perimeter fence that reads : medical research facility - oahu  hawaii .  remember  this is not a caption  but an actual sign .  i guess the location is on there for all those medical researchers who keep forgetting where they are .  theres a lot of major flipping action  too .  the first encounter between good and evil shows kahn and rayden swiftly arching though the air toward one another .  do they land and immediately get into the fighting ?  does one of them land first and catch the other off guard ?  do they collide in mid-air ?  no  apparently they flip toward each other so they can talk without having to yell from far away .  why did they need those metal balls to travel ?  everyone could have just flipped from point a to point b .  i have to admit  the fight scenes are pretty good  although you can tell they are heavily enhanced by digital effects and fly wires  allowing the characters to surpass the limits of the human body and the laws of physics .  the movies thrills are derived from these scenes and most of the audience responses are on the visceral level when someone gets trashed really badly .    ouch  was the most common expletive heard when i screened this one .  you could tell that the filmmakers knew in advance that fights  not plot  would be the main draw  since dialog is apparently in the film just to get from one fight to the next .  it seems thats all there is in this movie .  maybe it is .  as i had mentioned  the acting is bad .  theres not one solid performance in the film  although williams as jax was pretty funny .  after a fight between sonya and one of the bad guys degenerates into female mud wrestling  jax says   you look good in mud .  no  really  you do .   remar plays rayden with an inconsistency which makes it hard to take his character seriously  and shou is relatively emotionless as liu kang .  brian thompson  who has played good guys  bad guys  and even an alien on tvs the x-files  but always some muscle-bound behemoth  is your average evil demi-god  but its more the scripts fault than his own that he doesnt have anything original to say .  the one really impressive thing about this movie is that there is not one swear word in the whole hour and a half .  another thing which should be noted is that for all its punching and kicking  blood only appears in one scene .  all in all  mortal kombat : annihilation is loud  violent  shallow  and marketed toward kids .  hey  just like the video game !  , NEGthe swooping shots across darkened rooftops suggest a very tim burton movie  but  alas  no caped crusader descends to save * this * film .  instead  its a skeletal housemaid ( julia roberts ) who must bear witness to this unfortunate retelling of  dr .  jekyll and mr . hyde .   for a few  fleeting  maddening moments  director stephen frears ( dangerous liaisons ) gets everything just right-- the tone  the colors  the characters ; all the ingredients to make a most-powerful potion out of valerie martins best-selling novel .  yet it fizzles too quickly ; the volatile mixture losing potency from the very first scene .  casting is a large part of the problem .  the story all but collap- ses around ms . roberts-- she doesnt have the range for this kind of drama .  her accent also comes and goes  though its nowhere near as glaring as the total lack of chemistry between her and co-star john malkovich .   ( he looks the same in both of his roles-- an incredible fact thats missed by everyone in the story ! )  the very british supporting cast-- including michael gambon and george cole-- gives credibility to the smaller parts .  glenn close also appears as a madam that the good doctor calls upon .  her performance is as close to intentional camp as the movie ever gets and-- as a bonus-- offers a likely peek at her upcoming cruella de ville in the live-action 101 dalmantions .  the biggest botch in mary reilly is suspense : there is none .  no terror  no tension ; nothing .  without any weight  wit  or wonder to propel the story  the viewer is left with little more to do than pay attention to the period detail  a few buckets of blood  and stuart craigs fabulously dreary production design .  all of which gets old after about an hour  at which point i recommend leaving .   ( the pacing in the second-half is especially abominable .  if you * do * stick it through  your sole reward is a half-hokey special effect depicting the infamous transformation . )  mr . frears reportedly recut his film several times  missing several release dates in the process .   ( obviously  no one advised him to throw up his hands and just turn the whole damned thing over to mel brooks .  blucher ! )  mary reilly is the second robert louis stevenson story of the month  after muppet treasure island .  perhaps mr . frears should consult with brian henson on future projects .  i daresay that even ms . piggy is a better choice for a certain roles than julia roberts .  and she does have a great chop !  , NEGguilt . guilt is something i felt while watching basic instinct for the ninth time ; the penultimate t & a thriller  basic instinct made my last few teenage years worth living .  but i know so well that its a terrible film  made by a terrible director incapable of feeling guilt .  verhoeven went on to make the even more offensive showgirls and  on november seventh  1997  unleashed starship troopers to innocent moviegoers like me  who cannot control the urge to see giant bug movies .  the pic begins with the most unintentional laugh of the year .  a simple  white on black title card reads  starship troopers  -my friends and i speculated that the night before the prints were shipped  verhoeven realized he forgot the credits .  is this how a hundred million dollar movie should open ?  were the rest of the film that subdued . . .  starship troopers is about a group of white  blond-haired himbos and bimbos who all have spanish last names .  they graduate high school  join the military  and then  rather curiously  decide to travel to an alien planet and destroy all lifeforms on that planet .  the story is so incomprehensible  and told so bombastically  its akin to 129 minutes of someone screaming punishments at you in a foreign tongue .   ( aside  club lovers will be happy to know that dance music hasnt changed in the future . )  one plus : starship troopers contains some very funny sequences  specifically the newsreels of the future .  hysterically funny  actually .  but the cynicism of these reports left me curious as to whether verhoeven felt pessimistic about the story in between .  the storytelling lacks focus  to say the least .  the politics of the film are scary .  the actions of the major female characters are dictated by their out-of-control libidos .  theres even a creepy sex scene : the lovely dina meyer makes out  nude  with the sickening van dien while half her face is covered by her opaque sweater  just the way he seems to like it .  i use the term sickening because van dien is the least appealing actor ive encountered in a big budget picture ; all chiseled features and machismo  he even barks a eulogy at a funeral like military orders .  of course  verhoevens probably the one to blame  and perhaps im jealous because im so disgusting .  at any rate  a movie called starship troopers shouldnt be about sex .  exactly ten years ago  verhoeven made robocop  which was about nothing but skillfully made and oddly moving .  and r-rated  despite its goofy premise .  maybe its asking too much for verhoeven to make a pg-movie  then-hes a master of insipid violence .  however  ten year old boys would adore starship troopers if they could see it .  , NEG  whats your favorite new york moment ?     this ones climbing the charts .   starring john cusack  kate beckinsale  eugene levy  molly shannon .  directed by peter chelsom .  rated pg-13 .  theres no doubt that 95% of romantic comedies follow a distinct pattern : guy sees girl  guy wants girl  guy goes through unreasonable obstacles to get girl  guy gets girl .  in rare cases  the genders are flipped .  predictability is a given .  rarely  though  is a romantic comedy as cheap  as obvious  or as pointless as serendipity  a film that uses its  theme  as an excuse for its plot contrivances .    lightweight  doesnt begin to describe it .  this is like anti-gravity .  it begins in a new york city bloomingdales  a product placement that rivals cast aways fedex for sheer blatancy .  jonathan trager ( john cusack ) and sara thomas ( kate beckinsale ) both go for the same pair of gloves .  after going through the perfunctory motions  jonathan gets to keep the gloves and the two of them go out for ice cream  followed by ice skating .  jonathan falls hard  and sara is charmed .  when she writes her name and number down on a piece of paper  a truck rumbles by and blows it out of her hand .  she takes this as a sign from fate that they shouldnt be together ; jonathan is flabbergasted .  to pacify him  she comes up with an idea : jonathan will write his number on a 5 dollar bill  which she will promptly spend .  when she gets home  she will write her name and number inside a book (  love in the time of cholera  ) and sell it to a used bookstore .  if the bill gets back to her or the book to him  it will mean that they are meant to be together .  three years later .  both sara and jonathan are now engaged to other love interests .  both realize they arent content .  both go looking for the other .  what happens now is so absurd that im almost tempted to recommend the film for the sake of seeing it .  the two of them run circles around each other in a set of incredible  coincidences  that i would describe as contrivances if it werent for the film oh-so-cleverly dismissing that criticism by building its plot around  serendipity .   of course  since the movie is about fate  the screenwriter can do anything he damn well pleases .  im not buying it .  theres no suspense in any of this because we know exactly whats going to happen  but serendipity insists on drilling its purportedly  adorable  non-story into our heads .  instead of  will they meet ?   the question were asking is  when will they meet already ?   to make matters worse  every  coincidence  is telegraphed from a mile away ; by the last reel i was bored enough to actively look for signs that something else  incredible  was going to happen .  cusack is fine and beckinsale  at least  isnt saddled with another lumbering  clunky screenplay ( shes had bad luck  what with brokedown palace and pearl harbor on her resume )  just an inanely pointless one .  serendipity also relieves the tedium with the amazing eugene levy  who plays a snarky bloomingdales salesman .  whats the interest in watching a movie that spirals around and around a predestined ( no pun intended ) conclusion ?  serendipity wants to tug at the heartstrings  but it only tests our patience .  , NEGi didnt come into city of angels expecting greatness .  ive never seen wim wenders wings of desire  the classic movie upon which city is loosely based .  then again  i have seen enough stories which are based upon a similar plot device  with the little mermaid ( both the disney version and the original folktale ) being among them  that i had some high expectations about the possible power such a story of impossible love can hold .  unfortunately  city of angels ended up fulfilling few of them .  the plot  for those that couldnt tell from the previews  revolves around the angel seth  played with an almost creepy intensity by nicolas cage  who  in the midst of his angelic duties  falls in love with a heart surgeon named maggie ( meg ryan in her most endearing performance since when harry met sally ) .  of course  his being an angel prevents him from doing much about his love except appearing at random times to talk to her  watch her buy groceries  only to disappear in the blink of an eye .  their love must remain unrequited unless seth decides to make the ultimate sacrifice and become human .  using this framework as a jumping-off point  the movie attempts to veer through some heavy philosophical ruminations on the nature of desire  the joys of being human  and the definition of perfection .  the first half of the movie succeeds on most points .  cage excellently plays the eminently difficult role of an angel who doesnt know feelings so cant really express  preventing the character of seth from getting boring despite his limited repertoire of intent looks and hang-dog expressions .  unfortunately  cage takes the intensity too far sometimes  and then seth comes across as more creepy than sensitive .  as maggie  ryan manages to be convincing as a heart surgeon who has trouble coming to terms with her having lost a patient on the operating table despite having done everything right .  her beauty  unlike her unbearable cuteness in french kiss  is mature  intelligent  and winning .  likewise  some interesting ideas float around at the beginning of the film .  when the camera pans through traffic jams and libraries and we get to hear the thoughts of the random people who flash across the screen  the audience experiences a little of what it must be like to be an angel .  the beautiful camera work  shooting down onto the hectic world of los angeles from the improbable perches of the angels  also gives us a sense of the unique wonder angels feel .  the film begins to lose its way  though  when the focus tightens more and more on seth and maggie .  the grand  angelic perspective gets lost  except for some idly tossed lines about the incredible beauty of the world through an angels eyes .  the movie devolves into an examination of how seth cant feel the world or  more importantly  he cant feel maggie : he cant smell her hair  feel her touch  or taste the pears she eats .  this change in focus attempts to capture the audience in seths intense longing  but in doing so  the conflict disappears .  if he wants maggie so badly  then why doesnt her just make the leap and become human ?  after all  whats so great about being an angel ?  sure  you get to sit on marlboro signs  but whats that compared to getting to be with meg ryan ?  and from there  once the yearning has been established and the romantic denouement must occur  its all downhill .  the philosophy becomes heavy-handed  the dialogue pedestrian when it tries to be deep  and the plot twists simply attempt to yank a few more tears into the audiences hankie .  its the last thirty minutes of the movie  then  that wrecks the film .  i feel like the writer  by pulling out all the melodramatic stops  has robbed me of what could have been a genuinely powerful movie experience on both the romantic and the philosophical level .  i came out feeling robbed  seeing so much possibility in a film becoming nothing .  i could go on longer  but i dont want to  ruin  the end by revealing any of the cheap plot devices the film relies on .  city of angels  then  is a paradox .  its a well-acted ( particularly look for dennis franz cutting against type-casting as a happy-go-lucky fallen angel )  well-filmed  and based on a wonderful idea .  all these possibilities  though  are what make the film so unredeemable when the closing credits come up .  , NEGplot summary : the year is 2024 .  the ozone layer has long since gone and the earth is now protected from radiation by a shield invented by connor mccleod .  the shield  although saving lives  has made the atmosphere hot and humid .  connor is a mortal and a tired old man who has given up hope .  on returning from the opera one night connor is accosted by the leader of a  terrorist  organisation .  they have tried to find out what the company that now runs the shield unit are covering up .  connor is then attacked by two assassins sent by katana from the planet zeist ( like zeit--get it ? ) .  they fail and connor becomes immortal again by chopping their heads off .  he then brings ramirez back to life in glencoe in scotland .  both ramirez and connor are rebel leaders back on zeist and have been sent to earth as punishment .  connor now has the option to return being the last one but opts to stay with his new found immortality and fight to find out about the company and the shield .  katana meanwhile  fearing connor would return  sets out himself to kill the highlander .  if you have never seen it .  being a fan of highlander and mr . connery  i was in the cinema as soon as i could to see highlander ii : the quickening .  i wish it had been quicker .  i feel whatever else you can say about a film ( bad script bad music  etc . ) if you sit just plain bored through most of it then nothing much else needs to be said .  the film was short but in my opinion only twelve minutes or so ( the time mr . connery is on the screen for ) is worth watching .  the plot sounds a little ridiculous but i was willing to give it a chance .  maybe they could pull it off .  instead  i find that the characters have completely changed from those in the first film .  its as if they are different people with the same names .  witness connor jumping into bed with the leader of the resistance -- where is the attitude of  who wants to live forever  when love must die  gone to ?  the love sub-plot * must * have had footage cut out .  the highlander and ramirez both seemed aware of powers they had never mentioned before .  putting our heroes in deadly situations and then having them walk away because of some new power is very annoying .  i still want to know why connors coat becomes flame proof when he is immortal !  we are not given enough time on zeist to believe in it  nor are we told why advanced aliens still use swords to kill .  why not dynamite or laser saws or just plain bullets followed by a quick chop to the neck ?  i know the head needs to come off but you could at least immobilise your opponent with laser rifles first .  to be fair one assassin tried this but he must be the worlds worst shot .  meanwhile connor develops luke-skywalker-like powers of laser beam deflection .  as for  bad guys   we see a rebellion on zeist  crushed easier than a grape and then the rest of the plot depends on katana being obsessed with killing mccleod in case he returns to zeist .  two assassins are sent  presumably they are meant to be good at killing but an aged connor kills them both with no problems .  no more assassins are sent .  katana  supposedly a very powerful man goes himself to kill connor .  has he no more assassins ?  has he no better ?  why was the rebellion crushed so easily then ?  michael ironside is totally unconvincing ( bring back the kurgan ) .  he seems like a cartoon character and really isnt that evil  just stupid and violent .  we see the hollywood trick of the chief nasty threatening a child again and killing lots of innocents .  yet he still seems like no threat -- perhaps because he seems too stupid to threaten connor  or maybe because his two best assassins wouldnt have been amiss with larry  curly and mo .  so much for plot and characters .  the music is atrocious .  it is at best intrusive and at worst annoying .  bring back queen .  there was an audible sigh ( of relief ? )  when connor played a queen track in a juke box .  i believe this at least is to be corrected for the american release .  the acting is at best flat  except for mr . connery .  lambert is uninteresting and when he delivered  there can be only one  this time around it just made me wish there had only been one -- highlander .  michael ironside is unconvincing ; sorry  michael  i usually like you and everyone else was incredibly forgetable .  so why 2/10 ?  visually the film is interesting at all times .  it has a blade runner feel to it and some of the special effects are quite stunning .  add to this an irrepressible sean connery who smiles throughout the whole film -- or is he smirking to himself ?  his lines and delivery might make the film worthwhile had it not been so obvious that he cannot take the whole thing seriously at all but hey -- * id * have done it for 12 million .  oh  and i agree with a previous reviewer  she * does * look like sharon stone but i believe it is her first film .  incidentally there is a line producer credited and i hear rumours of highlander iii : the wizard .  , NEG200 cigarettes takes place on new years eve 1981 .  monica  played by martha plimpton is having a huge new years party .  everyone in town is trying to get there  but some are caught up in other things .  this is the basic plot of 200 cigarettes .  as we meet the characters headed towards the party  we are sent into many subplots which are unoriginal  and not interesting at all .  this disappointed me greatly .  the film should have been more about the party than the people trying to get there in my opinion .  lucy  played by courtney love  is with kevin  played by paul rudd .  the two are in a relationship that is more of a friendship  but starts to blossom into something more than that .  this subplot is extremely boring and dull  and i am getting quite sick of plots like that .  janeane garofalo is involved in another subplot  dealing with kevin .  she plays ellie  an ex-girlfriend of kevins .  this subplot is completely a waste of garofalos talent .  there was no point to it at all  and it was hardly even in the movie .  when lucy runs into a bartender  played by ben affleck  another subplot is formed .  the bartender is invited by lucy to come to monicas party .  at the bar  he runs into two more girls .  the girls are played by angela featherstone and nicole parker  but unfortunately  due to the terrible acting of both of them  i dont even remember their characters names .  ben affleck is a good actor  but his character doesnt go anywhere so he doesnt have much screen time to give a good performance .  featherstone and parker are horrible in their roles  and they are part of the reason the film is so bad .  christina ricci plays val  and gaby hoffman plays stephie .  the two girls are trying to get to the party but are extremely lost .  they meet some guys and end up going around with them all night .  this subplot was alright  but it was quite annoying with stephies accent .  hoffman did an okay job of acting  but ricci did good .  she was underused  considering she is such a wonderful actress .  another subplot in the film is the relationship between cindy  played by goldie hawns daughter  and jack  played by jay mohr .  jack is an actor who doesnt care about the girls he goes out with  he just likes dates for one night  and the next day he doesnt .  kate hudson is a huge klutz .  she gets herself into very funny situations  that are the funniest parts in the entire movie .  they are probably the only funny parts in the entire movie as well .  this subplot could have been used more  mainly due to hudsons performance .  mohr wasnt good  but he wasnt bad .  he was just alright  which i didnt find acceptable .  there is not much to say about the performances in the film .  none of the characters are developed or shown enough to really tell if the acting is good or not .  the only performances that i can judge are christina riccis as always good performance  kate hudsons funny role  courtney loves mediocre performance  and paul rudds annoying and overused performance .  i was hoping for a little more out of jaw mohr  ben affleck  casey affleck  gaby hoffman  dave chapelle  and especially out of janeane garofalo .  the two strongest things in the film were the great soundtrack and the original costumes .  martha plimpton and christina ricci had very different and original outfits which made me feel like i was in the year 1981 .  the soundtrack is full of 1980s tunes  ranging from  i want candy  to  tainted love .   the songs in the movie also helped create the feel that you were back in the 1980s .  during the film  i often found myself asking the questions   is there a reason to this ?  is there any moral story ?  is there a point ?  are any of the events going on in the film necessary ?  do i care what lucy and kevin are going through ?   the movie is extremely boring  and by the time they reached eleven-o-clock  one hour before midnight  i could not wait for the movie to be over .  the plot is okay  but the subplots make it terrible .  maybe if the film was about the party  not about the people at the party  it could have been a lot better .  the bottom line : just like a slasher movie  this ? 80s comedy is just one too many .  , NEGill bet right now youre just lounging by the pool  humming  i will always love you  and wistfully recalling your candlelight dinners with success .  it isnt necessarily over for you : i say you still have enough charm that you could avoid starring in  kevin !   for at least a few more years .  begin by scribbling  the star that burns twice as bright burns half as long  somewhere youll always see it  perhaps on the fridge door  or on a bedroom mirror with lipstick .  you had a heck of a thing going there until you agreed to star in robin hood : prince of thieves  where you were not only upstaged by powerhouses morgan freeman and alan rickman  but christian slater ( ! )  several dozen tall trees  bows  arrows  and a canoe  too .  after dances with wolves and jfk  you decided the world needed more three hour movies  expensive three hour movies  so you starred in and produced wyatt earp ; wyatt earp the man was a boring idiot who made the history books solely due to a general lack of famous wyatts .  wyatt earp was so dull a cowboy that he died of natural causes .  tombstone was a vastly superior movie based on the same legend  and that featured kurt russell as earp and dana delaney as his girlfriend !   ( she was played by joanna going in your movie-you know  the character known best in wyatt earp as  jew whore  .  what were you and lawrence kasdan thinking ? )  now  youre suffering the demise of yet another of your epics  the postman  a film so financially disastrous that it all but eradicated the memory waterworlds and tin cups mildly lucrative box office takes .  the postman is not the worst movie ever made-people in hollywood are quick to forget movies like howard the duck whenever the next bomb comes along .  yet it is a ridiculous movie .  i suspect you thought you had another braveheart on your hands-why else line up two armies on horesback  all prepared for battle  for the climax of your film ? -but    mailheart  the postman is not .   ( i can think of some more appropriate alternate titles : post encounters of the worst kind ; farewell  my salary ; howard the postman ; the postmans never watched twice . . . )  what a brown movie .  i hate brown .  you love brown .  dances with wolves was golden and brown-it looked like an eggo commercial .  the postman had me running for a glass of water every two minutes ; would the post-apocalyptic world look this maddeningly bland and dry ?  what exactly happened to this desert world  anyway ?  did we all become so stupid that we didnt immediately begin rebuilding homes  restaurants  and most importantly  shopping malls  after  the war  ?  why did you choose to drive the movies plot with a dumb group of terrorists who  well  terrorize townfolk across america ?  why is it only * they * have ammunition  anyway ?  was it really appropriate to cast your daughter as a girl who has a sweet crush on you  the drifter-cum-postman ?  why cast english actress olivia williams as an american ?  dont you realize that european women can only deliver their big emotional scenes in their native accent ?   ( take a look at the less-than-stellar performances of an american-ized nicole kidman or an american-ized minnie driver . )  who could give a damn whether you lived or died at the end of this movie ?  if it came down to a fight for leadership between you and the leader of the terrorists  why didnt you do that halfway through the film and save us all a lot of headaches ?  why cast will patton as the bad guy ?  because you worked with him in no way out ?  sure  hes a suitably creepy villain ; know why ?  because hes creepy in everything  including armageddon  in which he plays a heroic astronaut who practically slithers into his space suit !  why heroize the most demonic institution in america  the u . s . postal system ?  was tom petty supposed to be playing tom petty ?  if so  why didnt he look more skeletal ?   ( he should have been around 70 years old . )  why  oh why  do i have so many questions ?   ( i could ask plenty more . )  shouldnt a three hour running time have provided you enough space to answer everything ?  you have one great line in this film  and you deliver it to a mule ! :    the things i like about my ass . . .   i had to wonder .  actually  i enjoyed the tone of the opening scenes  a relaxed cynicism  if youll accept such clunky phrasing-too bad you couldnt resist the temptation to film yet another love letter to your country .  ultimately  im saying relax .  there is no quota  no need for you to make a picture a year .  settle down .  really question future screenplays before you commit to them .  feel free to write back .  i know how much you like letters .  , NEG  i seem to have glued myself . . .  to myself .   starring jason biggs  seann william scott  chris klein  thomas ian nichols  allyson hannigan  shannon elizabeth  natasha lyonne  tara reid  mena suvari  eugene levy  jennifer coolidge .  directed by j . b . rogers .  rated r .  american pie 2 reunites the cast members from american pie in a different setting ; instead of being high school seniors looking to score before they graduate  they are now past their first year of college and have gathered in a beach house to enjoy the summer of their lives .  jim ( jason biggs ) is still an insecure geek looking to improve his performance  oz ( chris klein ) is still the sweetest guy on the block  having sickeningly saccharine phone conversations with his studying-abroad girlfriend  stifler ( seann william scott ) is still a horny stoner  kevin ( thomas ian nichols ) still has no personality and finch ( eddie kaye thomas ) still longs for stiflers mom .  have i missed anyone ?  so  obviously  not much has changed .  this is not a problem  provided that the movie boasts the rapid-fire hilarity and unexpectedly true sentiment of the original .  but american pie 2 is the very definition of  sequelitis .   its coarser  yes  and it pushes the envelope even more  but its heart isnt in it .  its easy cash to capitalize off the first films success  but it would have been a worthier investment to prolong the franchise by coming up with something original .  part of the reason why the film doesnt work  i think  is that while in the original the kids quest for sex was a coming-of-age stepping stone as much as an outlet for their horniness .  here  everything has been cheapened .  they behave like those idiot frat boys who kill themselves drinking ; they have no motivation except for sex  sex  beer and sex .  thats not to say that you cant make a decent comedy from that premise  but it is one of american pie 2s undoings .  missing  too  is the sweetness that permeated american pie  the this-could-be-you quality of the main players .  here  the characters are too aware of themselves as pop-culture icons  and theyre even more one-note .  stifler and finch are now caricatures while jim  oz and kevin are forced to make awkward self-discoveries at arbitrary moments  none of them betraying what the writers think the audiences want to see .  and then theres the soon-to-be-notorious scene where jim superglues  himself to himself   which perfectly demonstrates yet another of the films ailments  one that also permeated say it isnt so  director j . b . rodgers debut .  theres a fine line between comedy and abject humiliation  and american pie 2 is on the wrong side of it .  its hard to laugh at the characters when you are profoundly embarrassed for them .  i shielded my eyes watching this more than i have watching any horror movie .  if theres one redeeming factor to american pie 2  its the inimitable eugene levy as jims dad  who pops in on jim as hes about to score and utters lines like  your mother and i have been known to get frisky . . .  not so much anymore  but . . .   and then when the girls parents walk in  blurts out  this must be your daughter !  i didnt get her name  but hopefully my son did .   if only the rest of the movie had the wit and wisdom of levys performance .  this is an unworthy sequel to a gross-fest that brought back the raunchy teen comedy .  the box-office of this onw should keep the genre going strong  which is disappointing .  the genre needs a hiatus ; filmmakers are getting lazy .  , NEGill be the first to admit it .  when you mention the book great expectations  i immediately begin experiencing flashbacks to junior high english class  where i was confronted with a torturously boring book filled with people with such nonsensical names as pip and magwitch .  yes  its a classic of literature  but it was a rather dry one  shoved down my young throat like a spoonful of bitter medicine .  certainly  the experience wasnt truly that bad  but  to quote ethan hawke in the latest movie adaptation of said book   im not going to tell the story the way it happened . . . ill  gonna tell it the way i remember it .   anyway  to return from nostalgia lane  and get back to the present  hollywood  in its trendy attempt to modernize the classics  now presents an updated film version of great expectations .  instead of pip  this time the central character is named finn ( played as a boy by jeremy kissner  and by ethan hawke as an adult ) .  finn is an orphan being raised by his unfaithful sister maggie  or should that be mrs . joe  ( kim dickens )  and her boorish fisherman husband  joe ( chris cooper ) .  the setting is the florida coast during the mid-70s .  finn is a blooming artist  and spends his time running around the beach drawing fish ( one of his two favorite subjects ) .  during one of these escapades  he literally stumbles upon an escaped criminal ( robert deniro ) .  borrowing a page from the superhuman max cady  deniros criminal has a seemingly limitless lung capacity  and favors hiding on the ocean floor .  ok . . . maybe  thats an exaggeration  but he certainly beats any of houdinis records in the opening scenes of the film .  and thats nothing next to the fuel efficiency of finns motorboat  but i digress .  anyway  finn does the convict a good deed  just to show that hes a really swell guy .  and then the plot moves on .  enter miss havisham . . . or  ms . dinsmoor here ( anne bancroft ) .  abandoned at the altar some 26 years ago  ms . dinsmoor is the epitome of the crazy rich old maid .  with bizarre clothing  eccentric mannerisms and a few pounds of makeup  anne bancroft seriously overacts in this role .  although she ends up nowhere near a believable character  she does add some humor to the film .  joe is hired to help with the gardening at her unkempt manner  but the insane ms . dinsmoor soon hires finn to be a plaything for her niece  estella ( raquel beaudene as a young girl  gwyneth paltrow as an adult ) .  for no apparent reason  other than to provide the main plot of the film  finn is instantly stricken for the estella .  perhaps its her snooty attitude or her utter disdain for his person  or maybe finn has simply never met a girl before .  in any case  neither as children nor adults  chemistry simply doesnt exist between the two  and yet finn spends the remainder of the film pining for her .  even when  as an adult  finn arrives in new york at the behest of a mysterious benefactor  reacquaints himself with estella  and draws her portrait in the nude  theres nothing .  in fact  there is more sexual tension between helen hunt and greg kinnears gay artist during a similar scene in as good as it gets .  at this point  the audience has grown as cold and detached as estellas character  and couldnt care less about the two characters .  the bulk of the blame here falls upon gwyneth paltrow .  she fails to imbue estella  a remote character in the book  with even the vaguest traces of humanity .  theres obviously something wrong when  watching the film  youre more interested with how big her nose looks in silhouette than you are about her character .  without a strong estella  finns obsession seems baseless .  you wish he would just stop whining  let estella marry his rival  walter plane ( an oddly subdued hank azaria )  and just get on with his life .  in fact  the two relationships that work in the film are purely tangential to the main plot .  finns relationship with his brother-in-law  joe  is interesting  if a bit stereotypical .  whats more fascinating are his interactions with deniro .  although its only a bit part  it goes to show how much vitality a strong actor can create .  it is apparent that director alfonso cuarsn put a lot of work in creating the imagery of the film .  some of the shots work  but others are too obviously staged ( for example  both of the water fountain scenes ) to have any impact .  finns art ( actually the creations of italian painter  francesco clemente ) is used throughout the film  but it mostly fails to have the intended effect .  we never see why finn would generate this style of art  which is simultaneously crude and insightful .  as a result  it ends up as distant as the rest of the film .  modernizing the classics is currently in vogue ( just see william shakespeares romeo+juliet ) .  simply update the action to a modern setting  and apply plenty of modern rock .  but such adornments do little to perk up great expectations .  as much as i dreaded the novel when i first read it  youd probably be better off suffering though a reading than watching this romanceless film .  , NEG  you damn dirty apes !   thats just one of the inadvertenty hilarious lines from planet of the apes thats taken on a comedic context over time .  no one back then seemed to realize how over-the- top charlton hestons acting style was  but it shows now  particularly in this  mystery science theater 3000  wannabe that was taken for a film masterpiece in its time  actually winning one oscar ( for makeup  no less ) and being nominated for a couple others .  it also spawned multiple sequels like beneath the planet of the apes  escape from the planet of the apes  return of the planet of the apes  beneath the escape from the return of the planet of the apes  planet of the apes : the next generation  police academy of the apes . . .  the list goes on .  heston is an american astronaut who spends a few thousand light years in space with his three companions and ends up on a planet not too dissimilar from earth .  the thing is  on this planet humans cant talk or think and the guys in the gorilla masks are the dominant species .  hestons companions are killed or turned into vegetables by the apon is imprisoned .  he surprises them all with his gift of speech  making two primate scientists ( roddy mcdowall and kim hunter ) believe heston is the missing link between ape and man .  believe me  we movie critics have been thinking the same thing for years .  when the two apes present the idea before a judicial counsel ( the head ape being shakespearean actor maurice evans )  it is received as heresy  for all good monkeys know god  created ape in his image .   but heston has already seen a cave that contains evidence that humans were originally the dominant species  before apes ever gained the ability to speak and run for president .  and he takes them there  holding up a baby doll and yelling   if humans couldnt speak  then how do you account for this talking doll ? !   and how do you account for your acting ability  mr . heston ?  the absolute most laughable scene comes with the movies surprise conclusion .  i wont reveal the details except to say it involves heston falling to his knees on a beach and yelling  god damn you all to hell !   several times in succession .  the movie is atrocious and should only be viewed by those members of society who like to watch bad movies and laugh at them .  what makes planet of the apes even more amusing is that it was supposed to function as some sort of social irony  a condemnation of fundamentals who reject the theories of evolution .  but let me tell you  if darwin could see the ape masks and hear the rotten dialogue exchanges ( heston [to female ape] : may i kiss you before i go ?  ape : but . . .  youre so . . .  ugly . )  hed convert to creationism on the spot .  luckily for us  science-fiction movies have evolved over time to the point at which some of them are actually good .  , NEGnew address .  same old attitude .  dont forget to recommend a film  read the journal  or send me some of that nasty hate mail . )  starring bruce willis  billy bob thornton  liv tyler  ben affleck written by jonathan hensleigh and j . j .  abrams directed by michael bay  it rocks-actually  lots of rocks fly at us or from us  in slow or fast motion  at several points in the film .  they seem like dangerous rocks because they kind of twirl through the air instead of just propelling forward  and when they land-once in a while  when we need a break from the space sequences-they cause damage enough to destroy the chrysler building and the like .   ( nary a mention of these apocalyptic events is made after they occur . )  they also just might be the most interesting element of armageddon  a steroid users answer to deep impact .  bruce willis stars as harry stamper  a famed oil-driller commissioned by the white house and nasa to stop a giant asteroid before it travels beyond  zero barrier  and destroys our planet .  why an oil driller ?  they require someone experienced with deep-core mining to plant a nuclear missile into said asteroid .   ( in one unintentionally ( ? )  hilarious sequence  nasa asks harry to inspect a deep-core driller they built based on his own blueprints ; it is poorly constructed-harry criticizes almost every aspect of it .  we trust nasa to build space shuttles that can land on twirling asteroids ? )  harry assembles the obligatory  ragtag  bunch of  cowboys   including a blond guy  a fat guy  a black guy  a wiseass  and the man who is sleeping with his daughter ( affleck ) .  once they reach space  we experience sequence after sequence of something going wrong-perhaps the fact that they sent a bunch of nincompoops into outer space has something to do with it ; i cannot count the number of times they almost fail the mission on all my fingers and toes .  whether or not they save the day  i will not reveal .  nor will you care .  i will say this : you know youre in trouble when deep impact dwarfs your asteroid movie in terms of emotion and scope .  willis has barely a chance to come alive ; ditto for affleck .  their big scenes are mostly reserved for the third act  in a last minute-and futile-attempt to inject warmth into the material .  steve buscemis character-the wiseass-is exceptionally problematic .    rockhound   as hes called  is sarcastic and foolish  so they tape him to a chair  where he spends most of the film .  so why did they bring him up there to begin with ?  rather  why write him into the film ? -give  his almost-witty one-liners to serious willis  who scowls and mopes and demonstrates psychotic tendencies : at one point he chases after affleck with his shotgun for screwing his daughter  firing often and causing significant damage to his oil rig .  im guessing he qualifies under nasa guidelines as someone unfit for space travel  at least in my world where the sky is blue .  liv tyler is pretty and humourless  as always ; suspiciously  four of her fathers bands (  aerosmith  ) songs grace the soundtrack .  director michael bay lays the visual and sound effects on thick  like ketchup  eventually drowning the movie on-screen .   ( the middle hour is a non-sensical  pyrotechnic assault on the average primates brain . )  whenever someone dies in this movie  a crew member inevitably yells out  we lost ( insert dead persons last name here ) !   i must admit that not once could i distinguish a dead oil-guy-cum-astronaut from a live one  and close-ups of the corpses faces beneath cracked helmets provided little assistance  as their skin was often covered in fake blood .  armageddon is not as terrible movie as godzilla .  it looks nicer  and has fewer plot-holes within its equally ludicrous framework .  it has a vivid soundmix .  but at almost two-and-a-half hours  i could not believe how little actually happened over the course of the story .  the love story has been played up in the ads  perhaps hoping to catch people before they recover from titanic-fever .  bollocks !  the lovers in the film are miles apart throughout-erase all thoughts of nude sketching or car-sex and replace them with obligatory shots of liv tyler tearing up while ben affleck dicks around in a moon-crawler .  remember a little film called jaws ?  in this film  three independent-minded men suddenly found themselves on a fishing boat in pursuit of a deadly shark .  they didnt much like each other at first ; eventually  they started to respect one another .  one of jaws great scenes involved the would-be-ahabs drinking and singing songs and telling stories .  this is the sort of male-bonding foreign to bay or his producer  jerry bruckheimer  who throw too many characters into the mix and expect well care about them on the grounds that the world is about to end .  not once do we get the feeling that these characters are even acquaintances-id be surprised if these actors bothered to introduce themselves to one another before  action  was called .  a male friend who loved the film suggested to me that perhaps i cannot relate to a bunch of men who dont bare their souls  who believe in dying macho concepts like heroism and a kind of chest-beating bravery .  to this  i will respond that the boys in armageddon are neither heroic  nor brave  nor smart  even : this team couldnt build a birdhouse .  and if i get no respect for disliking a movie with all the synthetic feeling of a trailer-a trailer for a movie written by a team of body-builders and greeting card authors-ive never been a prouder wimp my whole life .  , NEGthe one question that eats at me after seeing corky romano is why touchstone spent so much money marketing this throwaway film .  since june  i havent been able to turn on the tv or go to the movies without getting hit by some ad depicting chris kattan as the spastic corky  shrieking out a-has  take on me  in his yellow miata .  why would disney sink so much cash into the corky hype machine ?  honestly  i was hoping that all the goofball ads were actually a front for a decently funny movie .  man  was i wrong .  corky romano is one of those throwaway  clich ? -ridden tv-star-to-film vehicles built upon the most rickety of plots .  fortunately for chris kattans precariously positioned career  corky does have some good laughs  even if most of them are of the lowest-brow variety .  kattan plays the title character  the unsinkable assistant veterinarian corky who has a penchant for sunshiny 80s tunes  bright ties  and banal coffee mug slogans (  you dont have to be crazy to work here  but it sure helps .  ) .  when his mob boss dad ( peter falk ) is about to be put away on murder charges  his bungling  lughead brothers ( peter berg and chris penn ) rope in innocent  black sheep corky to infiltrate the fbi as an agent and steal the evidence .  predictably  hijinks ensue .  if the basic plot sounds bad  wait until you get into the inner-workings of this clunker .  the writers will amaze you with the depth of their inanity .  corkys fbi agent identity is named corky pissant (  thats pronounced pees-ahn .  its french .  ) .  he becomes a first-rate agent by accidentally stumbling mr . magoo-style onto the proper clues and talking his way in and out of situations  which plays like something out of a sitcom .  and not a good sitcom  i mean .  the romano family brothers even insult each other by farting in each others face .  and in a scene taken straight from theres something about mary  corky gives a dachshund mouth-to-mouth resuscitation .  but its not a complete disaster .  the manic kattan does occasionally rescue some comic moments  including a bit featuring a cat in a fat suit named jesus and another involving schoolchildren  a german shephard  and a kilo of cocaine .  plus  berg -- whose career has obviously gone downhill since the last seduction and chicago hope -- gives a great turn as the illiterate brother paulie .  and  its nice to see that richard roundtree of shaft fame is getting work .  unfortunately for those out there who cant truly appreciate animal or fart jokes  corky wont have much to offer you .  so the next time one of those pesky ads appears on your tv  asking   who is corky ?   you can simply reply   who cares ?   , NEGkids today  they dont just want to see heartthrob and master thespian freddie prinze jr . loving on the ladies .  no  they want to see him doing something that takes a little more in the acting department : namely  playing baseball .  through a series of drippy voiceovers  we are informed that theres no better proving ground for major league baseball than the cape cod summer baseball leagues  where college also-rans and hopeful dropouts go to play in the hopes of attracting big league attention .  our man freddie has landed a spot as a pitcher on the prestigious chatham as  where he is hoping for his big break .  its only after he is given ample time to show off his abs and scamper about in a womans thong ( dont ask ) that we learn what the real story of summer catch will be : that prinze is a poor townie named ryan dunne  struggling to make a name for himself ; that neither his father ( fred ward ) nor brother ( jason gedrick ) pulled themselves out of their blue collar jobs and resent anyone who tries ; and that the local beauty tenley -- tenley !   ( jessica biel ) -- is so far out of his league that he probably shouldnt even bother . . .  but of course he makes a play for her .  summer catch also makes an abortive stab at another half a dozen subplots -- the jealousy of fellow townie and brazen slut dee dee ( brittany murphy )  the alienation felt by ryans non-baseball playing best friend ( gabriel mann )  or the fat chick fetish of fellow player miles ( marc blucas ) .  worst of these is a ludicrous bit involving that 70s shows wilmer valderrama and beverly dangelo  both of whom appear in the film simply to provide a nutty mrs . robinson-like substory and to remind you of how much better done that was in bull durham .  in fact  virtually all of summer catch feels like its been done better somewhere else .  for starters  the film has a major question of identity .  its definitely not a sports movie  and it fails pretty miserably at being a romance .  the worst part is the amateurish script ( co-written by an arli$$ writing alumnus and a guy that starred in leprechaun 3 )  chock-full of phony emotion .  by the end  it all becomes a platform for each character to deliver a soliloquy to ryan that he must take to heart .  dad is on hand to give fatherly yet drunken advice .  coach ( brian dennehy  just loving the fact that hes got some work on the big screen ) is on hand to give the curmudgeonly counterpoint .  ryans catcher ( matthew lillard  playing himself again ) is on hand to tell ryan to  play catch  with him and make fun of the fat fetish guy .  ryans stoner best friend is on hand to give the go-get-em-tiger-were-behind-you talk .  and the girlfriend is on hand to give heartwarming-nuzzly-follow-your-dreams counsel .  before long  you start to wonder : is freddy prinze jr . is capable of having a thought of his own ?  dont answer that .  the only real joy in the film is found in biels character  and not just because of the skimpy outfits  which are also usually wet .  shes the only one in the movie that is able to do much with her role  taking the rebelling-against-daddy character to at least a passing grade .  when shes on screen  the time flies by .  when shes not  you realize that for some ungodly reason this movie is almost two hours long .  for a pg-13 teen romance ( despite near-constant sexual innuendo )  one has to ask warner brothers : what were you thinking ? ? ?  for her part  biel has fallen so far from her 7th heaven roots that she has almost become denise richards .  hollywood is either about to eat her alive . . .  or vice versa .  either way  good luck  jessica .  as for freddie  if he keeps pumping teen romances out at the rate of two a year  prinzes next  summer catch  is liable to be a venereal disease .  , NEGplot : two sister witches have to live with a curse placed upon their family  which prevents them from ever enjoying a full life with a lover .  the hex invokes the eventual demise of their loved one .  when one of their past loves comes back to haunt them  they have to figure a way out of their eternal dilemma .  critique : ive been waiting for a good witch movie for a while now  but hold on to your brooms and incantations  cause this puppy is far from being it !  for a film that has the word  magic  in its title  this movie contains very few moments of magic . . . or  humor for that matter  drama  suspense  or romance .  well actually  there is some manufactured romance within a plot that is so muddled  it never lets you in on whether its a comedy  a drama  a horror show  or a murder mystery .  or maybe its a romance  eh ?  it doesnt really matter  cause the characters in the film are so boring and uninteresting  that you have absolutely no basis on which to care for them  or the film as a whole .  if only the filmmakers had spent as much time on the plot as they did the sinfully obvious soundtrack  this film mightve had a chance to be more than what it is now .  which is an unentertaining  crappy film that uses the witch angle as a diversionary tactic to weave us away from its grab-bag of stupid voice-overs  overdone songs  melodramatic romance  undeveloped story and uneven acting .  i only wish that i could make that one hour and forty-five minutes of my life re-appear  but alas  it is lost in the spiritual world of  interesting ideas gone wildly awry  .  little known facts about this film and its stars : this film is based on the novel written by alice hoffman .  co-screenwriter akiva goldsman also wrote the screenplay for 1997s batman & robin .  director griffin dunne is known mainly as an actor in such films as an american werewolf in london and after hours .  , NEGtri-star ; rated r ( language  sexual situations  violence ) ; 87 minutes  director and writer : darren stein  cast : rose mcgowan  rebecca gayheart  judy greer  julie benz  chad christ  ethan erickson  carol kane  pam grier  tatyana m . ali .  review by : geoff berkshire  jawbreaker is the very definition of a  rip-off .   this uninspired teen comedy takes equal parts carrie ( 1976 )  heathers ( 1989 ) and clueless ( 1995 ) and mixes in all the necessary teen movie clich ? s .  along the way writer/director darren stein forgets to give the film a life of its own .  the film opens with a voice over from geeky fern mayo ( judy greer ) about the four most popular girls at reagan high : courtney shayne ( rose mcgowan ) who can basically be summed up as satan in heels  julie freeman ( rebecca gayheart ) a good girl with the face of a supermodel  marcie fox ( julie benz ) a dim-witted blonde who demands that people call her  foxy   and liz purr ( charlotte roldan ) an angel in disguise .  liz is everyones favorite because shes both beautiful and kind .  liz is about to turn 17 and  as a prank  courtney convinces the other girls to help her in kidnapping liz on her birthday morning .  in order to keep liz from making any noise courtney stuffs a jawbreaker into her mouth before they gag her .  they then stuff liz in the trunk of courtneys car but when they open it later  polaroid camera waiting to capture the moment  their lives will never be the same : poor liz has swallowed the jawbreaker and choked to death with it lodged in her throat ( the audience is treated to a few too many graphic looks at lizs dead body ) .  courtney  thinking fast  decides to pass the death off as a rape/murder and marcie and a reluctant julie assist her .  things get complicated when fern discovers what the three girls are up to .  in order to keep her quiet courtney comes up with another plan and transforms geeky fern into  vylette   hoping that she will also help to replace liz in the minds of the devastated students .  up until about this point the film is effective enough .  however  an investigation begins into lizs death and the film becomes excessively dull .  the recently rediscovered talents of pam grier are thoroughly wasted in the role of detective vera cruz and the film is downright insipid in its treatment of both the characters and the audience during this long middle stretch .  courtneys plan to frame a sleazy guy ( marilyn manson  in a brief cameo ) is never believable for a second .  meanwhile  the audience is stuck watching a string of random events which fail to develop the characters or add anything of interest to the plot .  julie leaves the group and begins a lame romance with aspiring actor zack ( chad christ ) .  he apparently gives her the courage to turn on courtney but the way things develop only make julie look stupid .  ferns rise to popularity is equally lame .  we do get the best scene in the film ( the only one with a spark of originality ) during this section .  its a smart and subversive bit where courtney gets the high schools resident jock stud dane ( ethan erickson ) to demonstrate  using a popsicle  exactly what he would like for her to do to him .  it at least provides us with a look at courtneys personality but the way the scene finishes doesnt make any sense .  stein is very conscious of the teen movie tradition he is working in and not only freely borrows major plot elements but also includes direct acknowledgment of this with some stunt casting .  william katt and p . j . soles ( students in carrie ) are lizs distraught parents  jeff conaway ( from grease ( 1978 ) ) is julies creepy single dad and carol kane ( the frightened babysitter in when a stranger calls ( 1979 ) ) camps it up as principal miss sherman .  at times jawbreaker feels simply like teen cinemas greatest hits but the audience is cheated with watered down interpretations of the best this genre has to offer .  the only notable aspect of jawbreaker is the incredibly stylish look .  the costume design by vickie brinkford and the production design by jerry fleming are both bright and vivid .  they were apparently instructed to work from the color palette of a jawbreaker and the screen is always splashed with bits of vibrant color .  director of photography amy vicent  who beautifully lensed eves bayou ( 1997 )  does a remarkable job here as well .  shot composition and camera movement is consistently impressive .  performances are mostly sub-par with mcgowan providing only a few good moments ( compared with her excellent work in the doom generation ( 1995 ) and scream ( 1996 ) ) and gayheart making the biggest impression due to the sweet nature of her character and her obvious beauty .  none of the actors look as if they have set foot inside a high school within the last five years with the exception of actress/singer tatyana ali  who has a small role as a cheerleader .  the male cast all resemble male models and are credited with names like  auto stud    college stud   and  high school stud #2 .   the soundtrack is decent and imperial teens catchy  yoo hoo  makes a bigger impression than any other aspect of the film .  , NEG  with all that education  you should know what happiness is .   starring sylvia chang  teresa hu  hsu ming  li lieh  mao hsueh-wei ; directed by edward yang ; written by yang and wu nien-chen ; cinematography by christopher doyle and chang hui-kung  every country has  eventually  its new wave .  france had its nouvelle vague  brazil its cinema novo  china its fifth generation  and on and on .  some waves just take longer than others  before they wash over us  cleansing us with the balm of discovery .  taiwans new wave came in the 1980s  in the work of directors like hou hsiao-hsien  wan jen  and edward yang ; that day  on the beach--yangs first feature--is central .  it created a new language for young taiwanese directors  even if the first attempts to speak that language were hesitant and faltering .  later works refined the techniques that yang first explored here  giving taiwan a distinctive international presence .  that day itself is long and frustrating  the document of a nations attempt to find a voice .  it does not lack ambition .  it anatomizes urban life in modern taiwan  in the manner of antonioni  elaborating the alienation that the westernized white-collar middle-class feel as their lives are shaped by old-fashioned roles--dedicated career men  loyal housewives--that they find unfulfilling .  jia-li ( sylvia chang ) is the focus  but the film brings others into its compass--her husband  her brother  friends from her college days--as it charts her discontents .  no one is happy .  jia-li married her husband  we-lei  at a young age .  at the time  her brother had been urged into an arranged marriage  despite his affection for another woman  and so jia-lis marriage seemed  in comparison  a good one : she chose we-lei of her own free will  they loved each other .  but it goes wrong .  that day dutifully presents all the clich ? s : we-lei becomes absorbed in his career  indulges in an affair with a co-worker ; jia-li feels restless and trapped  bound by a choice she made while young  but which no longer seems wise .  the film never redeems these clich ? s by conveying the feel of authentic experience  the intensity of lived pain  and much of it seems trite and belaboured .  it unfolds  awkwardly  as a series of flashbacks  told during a luncheon in vienna  where jia-li meets her brothers old flame ( teresa hu )  now a concert pianist  whom she has not seen since college .  both women seem rather sad  and resigned to their sadness .  their circumstances ( and those of jia-lis brother and a college friend ) suggest not so much that they have made the wrong choices--married the wrong man  chosen the wrong career path  etc . --but rather that the choices available to them were inadequate .  it is not that jia-li married the wrong man ; she didnt .  the problem is that she needed to marry at all--and that if she did not marry  she would still be just as unhappy .  for a woman in modern taiwan  that day tells us  the cards are stacked  the dice are loaded : she can play the game  but the house always wins .  the films sympathetic feminist implications are presumably the reason it caused such controversy upon its release in taiwan .  seen now  it does not seem provocative .  indeed  its hard to imagine anyone having felt passionate enough about the film to generate any controversy : it may be ambitious  it may be innovative  but it is also terribly  terribly dull .  and what was new for taiwan was not necessarily new for the rest of us : yang adopts methods established years before by antonioni and others  and his use of those methods is fumbling  uncertain  undisciplined .  nor does he bring anything new--other than the locale--to the material .  there are moments when that day takes on some of the emotional richness it strives for--in a young couples first kiss  in the awkward meeting of a woman and her husbands mistress--but they are brief .  too often  yang devotes needless time to mundane scenes--grocery shopping  flower-arranging--in which nothing happens  little is said  no emotion imparted .  perhaps  if the film were content to focus on such reflective  inward moments  leaving us to guess at thoughts and feelings  it might have been ambiguous  suggestive  insinuating .  but jia-li and her disaffected companions do not only brood in silence : they talk about their problems  at length  in detail  redundantly  and eliminate all subtleties .  at two hours and forty-five minutes  it all seems exorbitantly long  indulgently long-winded .  consider the defining moment for jia-li  the titular day on the beach .  the thrust of the whole film explains  easily enough  what we are to think of that moment  what it means when she walks away from a particular situation .  even so  the film has not one but two characters explain it for us verbally  in case we may have missed the point .  needless time is devoted to expressing what should have remained unexpressed  and that is the problem throughout .  the look of the film is as tedious as the drawn-out narrative .  it was the first feature shot by christopher doyle--at least  its his name in the credits--who is now rightly regarded as one of the worlds leading cinematographers .  in the freewheeling expressionism of his work with directors like chen kaige and wong kar-wai  he seems incapable of fashioning a boring image .  you would never know it from watching that day  which  due either to doyles inexperience or yangs humdrum direction  is almost perverse in its insistence on making the physical environment seem as drab and banal as possible .  in scrutinizing the long decay of a marriage  that day manages to capture the ennui of the experience  but none of the damage  none of the heartbreak .  , NEGthe first in a very long list of things wrong with  i still know what you did last summer  is the title .  think about it for a second .  if the last movie was called  i know what you did last summer   wouldnt the next movie have to be  i still know what you did two summers ago  ?  if anyone working on this movie had an i . q .  greater than five would have thought about it logically and said   hey . . .  wait a minute  .  but alas  the people behind this film are obviously idiots  so i wont hold them to that .  what i will hold them to is the fact that they have a pretty bad movie on their hands  even for a teenage slasher flick .  i guess im one of the few critics who actually kind of liked the original film ( emphasis on the  kind of  ) .  it wasnt great or anything and maybe not even necessarily good  but at least it didnt have me glancing at my watch every minute or so like its sequel did .  there are just so many problems with this movie that its hard trying to figure out where to start .  first of all  i guess  is the setting .  the movie offers no rational reason why the film had to take place in the bahamas  other than the fact that the producers wanted a seaside setting .  exactly why does the fisherman want to go through all the trouble of faking a radio contest to get julie james ( jennifer love hewitt  one of the only survivors of the first film ) and her new college buddies out to the islands before he hacks them up ?  the movie suffers from this kind of logic all the way through .  in one scene  julie is in a tanning booth at a deserted gym when the hooked fisherman with the slicker comes in and seals up the booth so the damsel in distress cant get out  no matter how hard she tries .  when julie discovers shes going to slowly fry to death  she screams for help and her friends come to her rescue .  now  this is all fine and dandy except for one thing ; instead of spending five minutes trying to bust open the booth  why not just turn the freakin thing off ?  in another scene  one of the characters  after having their significant other all but decapitated by the man in the slicker  says to julie   just dont tell anybody it rained the whole time .   oh yeah  ive just been terrorized by a hook wielding sociopath and had some of my best friends gruesomely slaughtered  but hey  ill crack jokes anyway .  after all  it is in the script .  the films only saving graces are a few well-executed suspense sequences and a really cool cameo by the  re-animator himself  jeffrey combs .  he brings some good comic relief and life to an otherwise limp movie .  way to go  jeffrey .  i have a hunch that the reason this film fizzles while the first one at least kept its head above water is the recent absence of writer kevin williamson .  with  scream  and even its sequel  he displayed a real talent as a screenwriter .  his ear for dialogue and the terrific endings he puts on all his films make him a standout from all the rest of the horror writers  and i think  i still know  has really suffered by not having him on board .  the cool atmosphere is still there this time around  but i just didnt like the characters or the writing as much as i did in the first one .  even though the movie doesnt have williamson  it still has a hacky ending  trying to do what kevin did with the first two  scream  s by ( some may consider this a spoiler  but if you have seen any horror movies whatsoever  then you should be able to guess the identity of the madman within twenty minutes ) having two killers and  this time  having one of them being a family member to the other .  i think someone in the audience put it best when  after the movie had ended with another  the killer is back !   cliffhanger  he said  who is this time  the grandma ?   all in all   i still know  tries to be as successful as the first the film was  but really fails in the attempt .  i mean  its okay when slasher movies rip-off each other  but when they start copying themselves . . .  , NEG  theres nothing new under the sun  is a phrase often used when the speaker actually means  lets find something to copy .   of course there are very few completely original ideas .  even earth-shattering concepts are built upon the vast body of human experience .  there is  after all  no need to re-invent the wheel time after time .  recently it seems that hollywood doesnt feel the need to even re-write the script .  my understanding of the word  sequel  is a continuation of the story .  the film industry has defined the word to mean reshooting the original with minor changes .  have an overwhelming desire to see an inferior version of brian depalmas adaptation of the steven king novel ?  this is your dream come true .  rachel ( emily bergl )  a high school outcast  is beginning to notice weird things happening around her .  doors slam shut by themselves .  glass globes blow up .  her mother has severe mental problems and her father is absent .  a popular boy unexpectedly asks her out .  the in-crowd conspires to embarrass her at a public event .  any of this sound familiar ?  once the audience catches on that this is the same story as  carrie   theres little to do but wait for the inevitable ending .  the effects are a bit better this time around  but the film doesnt work nearly as well .  there are a couple of minor plot differences .  rachel lives with foster parents because her mother is institutionalized .  the boys at her school are portrayed as even more evil than in the original .  they keep score of their scoring with points given for each conquest .  and  uh  there must be other story changes but none stand out .  one nice touch is the casting of amy irving again as sue snell .  over 20 years ago she was the one girl who tried to help carrie .  now a high school counselor  she befriends rachel  but her characters potential is squandered .  theres too much about sue that doesnt make sense .  after the slaughter when carrie kills most of her classmates  sue is driven mad and spends time in the institution that rachels mother is in .  still living in the same small town  the woman with a well-known history of mental problems is hired as a high school counselor ?  sue tells rachel that her telekinesis is a genetic disease .  this may be the one original idea in the film  but the reasoning behind describing psychic powers as a  disease  is never explained .  sues eventual fate is an admission by director katt shea and writer rafael moreu that they had an interesting character but couldnt figure out what to do with her .  blink and youll miss it .  some of the events are filmed in black and white  but the rationale for this is unknown .  it doesnt add anything and the choice of scenes appears somewhat random .    the rage  retains some of the trappings of  carrie  without the meaning .  in the first film the color red was a motif connected to carries onset of powers at the same time she began menstruating .  here theres an abundance of red  but for no apparent purpose .  the casting of high school jocks and cheerleaders as villains is beginning to wear thin .  one might be lead to suspect that most filmmakers were unpopular in school and the history of teenage films is an extended cinematic revenge of the nerds .  the biggest mistake the film makes is including clips of the original .  seeing sissy spacek on the screen only points to the quality of that film - and the flaws in this one .  , NEGplot outline - wendy ( samantha press )  a jazz singer  loves mack ( hugo race ) a criminal and wanna be rock singer whos planning a bank heist .  mack is also being tailed by a couple of cops  one an inexperienced rookie ( dominic sweeney )  the other ( john flaus ) a worn out veteran who frequents wendys jazz club .  theyre tailing mack  because he has an audiotape that may show evidence of governmental corruption .  meanwhile wendys sexually awakener  fifteen year old sister ( rebecca elmaloglou ) has moved in with her  and is secretly watching mack and wendys late night love trysts ? much zaniness ensues  the review : main problem first - about 2% of rood rock star to actor conversions in filmdom ever really work .  unfortunately  trying to cast hugo race as a violent  sexy criminal falls into the  what the hell where they thinking  category that takes up 98% of the rest .  but  hell  its not as if hes the only problem in this well-intentioned but ultimately below average aussie thriller .  leads  race and samantha press are wooden and dull  hampered by some unfortunate attempts at sexy dialogue early on .  though they do manage some heat later in their love scenes  helped  no doubt by them keeping their mouths shut .  the film suffers every time the story shifts back to these two .  which is unfortunately  the other main story isnt any great shakes either .  the second part  concerning two cops  political corruption and that elusive tape is incredibly muddled .  at many points during the movie i had no idea what was going on  a situation that didnt improve on repeated viewing .  there is no doubt that this films achilles heel is its script .  as for the rest of the cast  its a mixed bag .  john flaus  one of australias most criminally underused actors  is in top form as the withering  alcoholic jazz fan cop  who may or may not have sold out to the highest bidder .  although he falters at one point  when the script calls for him to get up on stage and deliver a drunken beat sermon  but believe me  they way it was written  no one could have pulled it off .  dominic sweeney is fine  though he seems to be uneasy in front of the lens but he really isnt given a whole lot to do .  pre home and away elmaloglou is pretty good as the inquisitive jojo  but her character seems extraneous to the story  well  at least until the final scenes .  i must admit  in too deep does have some impressive qualities  not the least of which is it visual element .  cinematographers mark gilfedder & peter zakharov have achieved the almost impossible by making melbourne look like a sweat drenched tropic city  which is akin to turning london into san paolo .  the bar is an oppressive red  like all of its patrons are being baked while they drink  outside it hazy orange by day and cool blue by night .  if only deborah parsons script could have supported this idea better .  having two directors ( colin south & john tatoulis ) doesnt help either  the most glaring example of which is the final retribution/fight scene  where for some reason the camera pulls away from the onscreen action  and more importantly it doesnt pull away to anything else .  it just stays static as the fight happens in the distance .  it has no reason to it ; its just bad direction .  and  ultimately  that is what sums up in too deep  its tries to be good  and you want it to work  but  its just lacking the talent behind it  that it needs to succeed .  , NEGthe scene at the end of 1989s `dead poets society   when robin williams english students stand up on their desk and say  `captain  my captain   gets me every time .  unfortunately  the court room scene near the end of robins newest film  `patch adams   doesnt have anywhere near the same impact .  from the surface `patch adams looks very promising .  its a story about a not so young man  patch adams ( robin williams )  who finds meaning in his life through helping sick people .  when the film opens  we find patch  depressed and suicidal  checking himself into a mental hospital .  in a few scenes  strongly reminiscent of `one flew over the cuckoos nest   he ends up helping the patients through their problems ; and its here that he finds how much he loves working with people .  so he checks himself out of the hospital  and heads straight to medical school .  right from the start  patch uses comedy to help make the patient more comfortable .  he continuously breaks medical tradition and makes the dean of the school angry .  shortly after joining medical school  he meets and falls in love with carin ( monica potter ) .  they  along with patchs dork friend  truman ( daniel london )  start a medical clinic for uninsured people .  once the dean catches wind of the clinic  he tells patch he cant graduate and kicks him out of school .  patch  like what any true american would do  takes the school to court .  its here where the not so climatic court room battle takes place  over whether or not patch can become a real doctor .  i have never seen a movie with some potential just completely blow it .  it seems more like a series of short sketches  rather than a full-length movie .  considering it runs almost two hours  much too long for such a light film  it could have flowed much smoother .  not to mention the fact of how serious the film takes itself  and manages to cover all the cliches of bad melodrama .  robin williams saves the film from being abysmal with several comic scenes that elevate the movie to entertaining and worthwhile levels .  but those moments are rare and in the end `patch adams is barely average .  , NEGthe real blonde ( r ) a womans face  an arm  some pumped-up pectorals  blond hair  a mans sad face  slender legs  a random hand here and there .  as the opening credits of tom dicillos the real blonde unfold  these scattered  fractured glimpses eventually come together to form the image of a bikini brief-clad man on his knees clinging to a nurturing woman  his head concealing her unclothed breasts .  if only the rest of this formless  aimless ensemble comedy assembled so coherently .  joe ( matthew modine ) is a waiter/struggling actor too proud to take gigs in commercials or soap operas .  hes feeling somewhat dissatisfied with his relationship with his live-in love  mary ( catherine keener )  who holds some subconscious hostility toward the male gender .  mary  a makeup artist  regularly works on model sahara ( bridgette wilson )  who is obsessed with the underlying messages in disneys the little mermaid .  the bottle blonde has a turbulent on-again  off-again relationship with bob ( maxwell caulfield )  a soap actor who yearns for the taste of a real blonde  which he finds in co-star kelly ( daryl hannah ) .  as the film unspools  a variety of other characters pass through : fashion photographer blair ( marlo thomas ) ; marys shrink ( buck henry ) and self-defense instructor ( denis leary ) ; joes casting agent ( kathleen turner ) and hardass boss ( christopher lloyd ) ; and a mystery woman ( elizabeth berkley ) who keeps on crossing joes path .  where exactly does all this go ?  thats a question best posed to writer-director dicillo  who doesnt appear to have the slightest clue himself .  his meandering  largely unfunny script and direction are like hopelessly lost drivers  turning into dead-end narrative streets only to reverse course and hit another creative cul-de-sac .  and another .  and another .  at one point bob  frustrated with the soap scripts  complains to the head writer ( jim fyfe ) that his and kellys characters keep on going in circles  with no hint of development or growth .  that is most certainly the case here .  joe gets a job and ultimately botches things ; he and mary bicker ; they make up  only to have the pattern repeat itself .  unhappy with his bottle blonde  bob gets his real blonde but is unsatisfied ; he returns to the faux and is still unsatisfied .  if there is a point to all of this  dicillo dances around it  spending his time on apparent digressions that  as it turns out  arent digressions at all .  the real blonde is not without some amusements .  it does have the occasional funny line and situation ; leary  henry  lloyd  steve buscemi  and dave chappelle shine in their small roles ; keener is a likable  refreshingly earthy lead ; berkleys appearance is mercifully brief ( she receives outrageously prominent billing and ad placement for a ten-minute role ) ; and there is the irony of having caulfield play a wildly popular soap star who makes the ratings skyrocket ( last year  the actor was fired from the daytime drama all my children after a scant six months--due to lack of viewer interest ) .  but on the whole  the real blonde is a frustrating sit that lives up to the stereotypes of its title--it may be glossy on the surface  but theres nothing going on inside .   ( opens february 27 )  , NEG  jack frost   is one of those dumb  corny concoctions that attempts to be a heartwarming family film  but is too muddled in its own cliches and predictability to be the least bit touching .  this does not come as a surprise  since the studio that made it is warner brothers  who is on a current streak of one bad film after the other .  jack frost ( michael keaton ) is a struggling middle-aged rock musician who loves his wife  gabby ( kelly preston )  and 11-year-old son  charlie ( joseph cross )  but doesnt spend nearly enough time with them .  when he receives a call from a music label that wants to hear him play  he has to cancel his planned family outing up in the mountains for christmas .  halfway there  jack has second thoughts  but on his way back home  is in a car accident and dies .  switch forward a year  christmas is approaching once again  and charlie and gabby are still having a difficult time coming to terms with jacks death .  when charlie begins to play the harmonica his father gave him the night before he died  the snowman outside the house is taken over by jacks spirit .  jack wants to spend some time with his son before the upcoming warm front melts him  but charlie desperately tries to prevent his melting demise .    frosty the snowman   is a classic cartoon  and the idea of a snowman that is alive works splendidly when animated  but as a live-action film  it doesnt work at all .  after a somewhat promising prologue in which the frost family is established   jack frost   quickly goes downhill  especially once the snowman comes into play .  since jack has been deceased for a whole year  you would think there would be many questions to ask him  such as   what happens after you die ?   or   how does it feel to be a snowman ?   but instead  the film focuses on a snowball fight subplot and an inevitably oversentimental climax that could be telegraphed before i even sat down to watch the movie .  the performances are respectable enough  but no one deserves to be punished by appearing in a silly film like this .  michael keaton at least got off easy  since he disappears after the first twenty minutes  but what exactly does he think he is doing with his career here ?  i have always liked kelly preston .  she is clearly a talented  charismatic actress  but has never been given a good role in her life  usually having to settle for a one-dimensional supporting character  as in  1997s   nothing to lose   and   addicted to love .   joseph cross was probably the highlight in the cast  since he believably portrayed a boy suffering the loss of a parent .  in one of the only subplots that actually works  due to its wittiness  henry rollins is highly amusing as a hockey coach who becomes terrified and paranoid after seeing the live snowman .  this brief hint of cleverness is pushed to the side  however  by the tried-and-true main plot at hand  which is the sappy story of a father and son .  since i knew what was going to happen by the time the conclusion came around  i had no choice but to sit there and listen to painfully insipid  cringe-inducing lines of dialogue .  some of my favorites was an interaction between the son and father :  you da man   says charlie .    no  i da snowman   replies jack .  or how about this little zinger  coming from a school bully that miraculously becomes friendly towards charlie and tries to help him out :  snowdad is better than no dad .   do people really get paid in hollywood for writing pieces of trash like this ?  the snowman  created by john hensons creature shop  is more believable than the snowman from last years unintentionally hilarious direct-to-video horror flick  also called   jack frost   but it still was difficult to tell if it was a person in a suit or computer effects .  either way  it was an awful lot of work to go through  just to come up with a final product as featherbrained as this project .  as a seasonal holiday picture   jack frost   is pretty much a clunker .  a better christmas film from this year is   ill be home for christmas .   better yet  my suggestion would be to stay home and watch a quality film  such as   its a wonderful life    a christmas story   or   prancer .     jack frost   is an earnest  but severely misguided film  and children  as well as adults  deserve better .  i doubt they would want to see a movie about the death of a parent  anyway .  , NEGsome movies require you to turn off your brain in order to watch .  then there are movies that require you to accept that everyone * in * the movie has turned off * their * brains .  the real mccoy is both .  its charmless  molasses-slow and so full of genuinely stupid people that the film commission of atlanta  where the real mccoy is set  might well consider some sort of ritual suicide for their complicity in this humiliation .  the real mccoy opens with bank robber karen mccoy ( kim basinger ) being arrested in the middle of a job .  six years later  karen is out on parole and looking to stay straight .  she soon bumps into j . t . barker ( val kilmer )  a hapless would-be thief who idolizes karen .  j . t . also has ties to jack schmidt ( terence stamp )  the man who blew the whistle on karen six years earlier for refusing to work with him .  schmidt  who is in cahoots with karens sleazy parole officer ( gailard sartain )  again wants karen to help him stage a robbery .  this time he has some leverage : karens kidnapped son .  just when she thought she was out  they keep pulling her back * in . *  contrivances and sloppy plotting fly off the screen so fast and furiously you have to duck to avoid being hit by them .  leading the list is the jack schmidt character  who through unexplained but presumably foul mains is already extremely wealthy when our story begins .  there is no reason given why he should need or want to get involved in another crime  let alone why he would actually participate in the break-in .  karens initial encounter with j . t . during a botched convenience store hold-up also strains the limits of credibility .  it would have been simple enough to have them somehow entangled at that point  but instead they run into each other the next day because theyre leaving their parole officers at exactly the same moment .  small world  eh ?  then theres the convenient car trouble during an attempted escape  and pet tigers which  through the power of the laws of bad cinema  must inevitably confront someone who has blundered into their cage .  however  the buffoon prize goes to the atlanta police  who come off like the keystone kops on a bad day .  but the fun doesnt end there in the shambles of a script by william davies and william osborne .  there is also the absence of a single  solitary interesting character .  karen is earnest and single-minded in her motherly devotion  but lacking any kind of edge which would make her a convincing criminal  and basinger is not a thespian adept at fleshing out flimsy material .  schmidt is a flaccid villain  the parole officer is a complete blank  and karens son and ex-husband might as well be furniture .  only kilmers j . t . is remotely appealing  but his one potentially intriguing quality  his ineptitude  is never developed .  in fact  kilmer disappears during the middle of the film  just when his admiration for karen could have made for an interesting sub-plot .  i might have been more forgiving if the pacing had been more appropriate to a caper comedy  but the real mccoy goes nowhere fast .  various scenes of sneaking and skulking seem to take forever  and some end with no reason evident why they didnt end up on the cutting room floor .  even the reasonably clever climactic break-in falls victim to this syndrome  including a scene of one of the thieves drilling open a vault which lasts ( i kid you not ) four minutes .  there is no tension in the scene  just tedium .  russell mulcahy ( highlander ) is a director with some style  and indeed the real mccoy looks reasonably good  but he completely stumbles in the editing room .  there are so many big problems with the real mccoy that im tempted to overlook the little ones .  like karen disarming one of schmidts henchmen and throwing his gun into the middle of a park where her son is playing .  like a fountain crushed when a van runs into it reappearing in one piece a few moments later .  tempted . but im pretty good at resisting temptation .  , NEGyou think that these people only exist in the movies  but trust me  theyre as real as life .  i once talked to a guy who thought the united states government was putting satellites into orbit which could fry an individual persons brain with microwaves .  then i sat in a room full of people who believed that the government rigged state elections .  i even listened to a man who swore that nicotine was an additive that cigarette companies put in their products for the specific goal of getting people addicted .  these people had what are known as  conspiracy theories  - ideas about how unseen forces work to deceive and control the public .  a little imagination goes a long way .  in richard donners conspiracy theory  jerry fletcher ( mel gibson ) is a new york city cab driver who seems to have a conspiracy theory about everything .  his latest  that nasa is trying to kill the president by causing an earthquake from the space shuttle  might sound outrageous to us  but is all in a days work for him .  he combs the newspaper  looking for tidbits that leave telltale warnings about the goings-on behind the scenes  and from there jerry draws his conclusions .  upstanding citizen that he is  he tries to convince alice sutton ( julia roberts ) of the justice department that the president must be warned .  lucky gal  alice  who met jerry when he saved her from a couple of muggers and has had to listen to his theories during the six months since .  what she doesnt know is that jerrys interest in her is far more than  well  professional .  he goes to great lengths to follow her around and watch her in her own apartment .  but when some secret government types seem to take an interest in jerrys ideas and his limited-circulation  conspiracy theory  newsletter  he finds himself in danger and in real need of alices help .  one of the problems with conspiracy theory is that it tries to pass itself off as an action-thriller when it seems to have neither a whole lot of action  nor a significant number of thrills .  part of this is a result of the films slow pace .  it takes forever to set up the relationship between jerry and alice  and even once that is over with  the rest of the film seems to be a lot of boredom that every once in a while stops to take a break for excitement .  at over two hours  this film could have been significantly condensed and had its running time shortened by twenty minutes to half an hour  but even then  the action scenes would not be able to save the film .  instead of truly exciting and engaging set pieces  were treated to a few of the generic scenes with the requisite  black elements  : black helicopter  men in black action suits and body armor  black vehicles - you know the drill .  they come on down with all kinds of neat gadgets and weapons  but for some reason a guy with just a bunch of theories and some chick with no training somehow manage to elude them every time .  big deal  weve seen it all before .  watching the film  i wished donner had at least tried to use a little imagination  but i was out of luck .  now  when i say it took forever to set up the  relationship  between jerry and alice  i completely mean what one person is relative to the other  and not romantic involvement .  oh  donner and screenwriter brian helgeland would like you to believe that by the end of the movie  the two main characters will end up falling hopelessly in love with each other  but there seems to be no evidence of that ever occurring .  you see  there were more sparks between gibson and danny glover in the lethal weapon movies ( also directed by donner ) than between gibson and roberts in conspiracy theory .  the two just dont click  and when you throw in a number of happenings that would cause alice to reject jerry altogether ( like finding out hes been stalking her )  the subsequent attraction is absolutely forced .  the script in general also seems forced  like someone sat helgeland down and forced him to write it  then took it and forced it upon us .  dialog is undistinguished and rather unmemorable  to the point that i almost stopped listening .  even gibsons usual gift for ad lib couldnt punch up the film sufficiently to raise my interest  although one of jerrys theories about oliver stone was mildly amusing .  unfortunately  much of whats discussed in the film is not inherently important to whats going on  but instead filler that starts out with potential  but ends up just being extraneous because its never followed through .  for example  jerry professes that a man found drowned in his swimming pool was actually murdered by the government in a new york subway station .  he even goes so far as to explain that the station was flooded at the time due to a water main break ( hence the water in a subway station )  and that the coroner should check the mans lungs for chlorine .  this is convincing enough to alice that she seems to believe him .  you know what happens then ?  nothing  zip  nada .  no follow-up whatsoever  so whats the significance ?  okay  heres another one .  a couple of well known ( real life ) assassins were found to have possessed copies of the j . d . salinger novel  the catcher in the rye  .  jerry also has a bunch of copies .  whenever he goes into a bookstore  he has to buy one .  leaving out the question of whether or not this makes jerry an assassin  were never given a reason to believe why this would make him an assassin .  not when we find out about his salinger collection  not when he goes to the bookstore  not later on when we get the answer to our first question .  the point becomes totally extraneous .  oh  did i mention that patrick stewart is in this film ?  yeah  he plays this government psychiatrist named dr . jonas who may or may not be a bad guy .  thats about it .  for all the presence this usually marvelous actor has  hes nearly forgettable in conspiracy theory .  you can just lump him in with the supporting players  with the exception of cylk cozart who plays agent lowry of the fbi .  this guy was really likable  and i wish he and his character had gotten more screen time .  okay  heres my theory .  this really started out as a great film  but some of its jokes were actually true !  the government came in and forced donner to make edits for the sake of national security  and this was what was left over .  , NEGmy son and i share a perverse predilection for bad movies .  we are amused and entertained by the cheap thrills  the corny dialog  the ludicrous premises and the bad acting .  since other family members aspire to higher forms of entertainment  we usually wind up indulging our proclivity together .  i cant remember when we disagreed on the relative merits of a clunker until species 2 came along .  he was not amused .  i on the other hand was able to easily suspend the applicable requirements in the usual manner and declare myself suitably entertained .  perhaps the evident skills that were brought to the process of producing a bad product was what prevented him from extracting fun out of mediocrity .  i on the other hand appreciated the fact that the producers and director knew exactly what they were doing : insulting my intelligence  and brought adequate movie-making skills to the project a movie does not have to be good to be well made  at least in terms of the craft .  the movie could have been better if it were not so brusque .  this movie slaps you with conception  pregnancy  delivery and young childhood in consecutive frames  without pausing for infancy .  the producers of nescafe have nothing on this alien race in which a womans womb balloons immediately after the male orgasm  and a few seconds later a young child tears its way out of her abdomen in a sloppy and gory version of an inside-out cesarean .  an autopsy scene in which a buzz saw cuts through the cranium was not the kind of indulgence that i condone  to say nothing of the fact that it was scientifically incorrect .  in a real autopsy the saw does not cut through the scalp ; it is used only after the skull has been exposed .  the opening sequences of exploration of mars were very good .  the writers showed excellent skills for ceremonial speech writing but the spontaneous dialogue would qualify for a subtitle : `as bad as it gets .  as the movie progressed i vowed to remember the lines that made me cringe but only one stuck .  eve ( natasha henstridge ) was cloned from sil  the original alien sexual predator  but her mating instinct was artificially attenuated  which was all that was needed to turn her into a noble and cooperative prisoner .  in a wistful display of resignation and understanding she tells her friend and jailer ( marg helgenberger ) : `i think of all the places that i will never see and all the people that i will never meet .   its enough to melt the most callous heart .  at another point she protests : `im human too  you know .   she is only half right .  peter medak  the director  knows his business .  justin lazard as the doomed astronaut does nothing to enhance his hollywood credentials .  james cromwell  his father  is perfect in a short role .  marg heldenberger  the dna scientist is pleasant and beautiful .  natasha is an exquisite ornament .  george dzunza knew and delivered what was expected of him as the dumb general that messes things up .  michael madsen was there .  black buddies do not usually survive in this type of movie but mykelti williamson manages to stay around for the final credits  which is more that we can say for lazard . .  , NEGit seemed like the perfect concept .  what better for the farrelly brothers  famous for writing and directing comedies with offensive subject matter  than to make a movie about a guy with a split personality ?  its exactly the sort of thing the brothers relish : poking fun at something serious ( in this case mental illness )  throwing all care to the wind to get a laugh .  jim carreys signed on too ?  even better .  the national alliance for the mentally ill even helped out by levying complaints against the brothers new film before its opening  claiming it was misrepresenting the condition of split personality  labeling it incorrectly as  schizophrenia   and so forth .  such a protest seemed like just the sort of thing that would  of course  only add more fuel to the farrelly brothers fire  proving that some people just couldnt take a joke  and that the farrellys would be helping the more enlightened viewers to yet another dose of their brilliantly subversive comedy .  yes  it all seemed perfect  but one thing went wrong : their movie isnt funny .  its not for lack of trying .  the farrellys utilize in  me  myself & irene  their most high-concept premise ever : carrey plays charlie baileygaites  a man who after being dumped by his wife for a midget limo driver  decides to bury all his aggressive feelings deep down inside and never release them .  this  of course  means all his neighbors exploit his entirely too-forgiving nature  making his job as a rhode island state trooper increasingly difficult .  soon enough  charlies repressed aggression manifests itself into a second  independent personality named hank  a deep-voiced  boorish ogre unafraid of taking the assertive actions his predecessor had been unable to muster .  this guy isnt above crashing a car through the wall of the barber shop in which hes been insulted  or holding a little girls head underwater because she refused to stop jump-roping in the street .  then things start getting lost in the most complicated plot the farrellys have ever attempted  and the film runs off its tracks .  some have suggested that this isnt a problem  because the farrelly brothers brand of humor doesnt require plot to work .  theyre wrong  of course : plot was greatly instrumental in building up the kind of rollicking comic energy that infused the farrellys last effort  1996s  theres something about mary .    ( 1999s  outside providence  was technically an earlier project . )  the brothers earlier film wasnt funny merely because it contained outrageous gags ( despite what some newsmagazine articles would have you believe )  but rather because its most outrageous gags were entirely unexpected .  in  mary   the farrellys managed several times to pull off a neat sleight-of-hand trick : theyd have you thinking the story was going one way  then reveal its real direction in delightfully surprising fashion .    me  myself & irene   by contrast  seems to have been made by folks who looked at  mary  and saw only the surface grossness  missing all of the subtle machinations that really made it work .  having been produced by the same guys who made  mary    irene  seems like an even bigger disappointment .  the brothers pile on the offensive humor  taking shots at race  midgets  albinos  mental illness  and all manner of bathroom jokes .  but they havent come up with a way to make any of it fresh most of  me  myself & irene  comes off as rote  by-the-numbers  adolescent comedy .  the plot  with carrey forced to drive alleged fugitive irene p . waters ( renee zellweger )  whos in more trouble than anyone knows  back to new york  has an ending thats entirely predictable from the get-go .   ( think charlie and irene will fall in love ?  yeah  me too . )  the farrellys then introduce scores of different characters  and none of them ever manage to do anything you havent already expected them to do  no matter how outrageous their actions might be .  compared to the curveballs the farrellys are used to throwing  this stuff is almost entirely soft-tossed  presenting an obvious problem : when gross-out humor loses its shock value  its no longer funny  merely gross .  the jokes that do work are milked over and over until their effectiveness runs dry .  take  for example  the subplot involving charlies three black sons ( anthony anderson  mongo brownlee  jerod mixon ) .  the incongruity of it all is funny for a while  with three burly black men discussing higher math in ghetto language and white-bread carrey mouthing said language with an entirely too-pleasant smile on his face .  but by the end of the film  theyre still doing the same schitck it hasnt been elevated to another  funnier level  and it hasnt been dropped either .  thats too bad  because it ceases to be amusing about halfway through .    me  myself & irene  reeks of wasted opportunities .  there ought to be more focus on how other people react to charlies new personality  and on how charlie deals with the consequences of hanks actions .  this doesnt really happen nearly every supporting character learns about charlies condition early on  so they dont have any opportunity to be surprised by it .  the film throws what looks like a patented farrelly curve in a scene towards the midway point ( involving an albino companion charlie and irene pick up called  appropriately   whitey  )  but the script doesnt go anywhere with it  instead leaving the thread twisting in the wind before awkwardly tying it up during the climax .  jim carrey is a gifted comedian  both physically and vocally  but hes left with nothing much to do here except contort himself in a manner similar to steve martin in  all of me .   its a great showcase of flexibility and split-second role-shifting  but none of it is terribly funny .  carrey doesnt pull any stunts we dont expect him to pull  and the farrellys script doesnt give him anything else to pull : the situations in which he must perform the role-shifting arent set up in any meaningful way .  perhaps carrey can take solace in the fact that his supporting actors fare no better .  zellwegers irene is not a strong female lead mary in  mary  may have been part adolescent fantasy  but she was also intelligent and strong-willed .  irene is nothing in particular  as the film never makes clear whether shes ditzy  clever  or neither .  as such  she gives us nothing to latch onto as the only  sane  person in the film .  chris cooper is stuck playing exactly one note as a corrupt fbi agent  and his character is entirely too straight-laced for a movie like this .  he  like the others  does absolutely nothing unexpected .  after viewing the shapeless mess that  me  myself & irene  eventually dissolved into  i was stuck wondering whether or not the farrellys had outsmarted themselves .  maybe their kind of comedy can only work for so long until audiences get wise to it and stop being shocked .  but i dont believe it -- good filmmakers find ways of surprising their audiences even after people have grown attuned to their style .  if the farrellys are indeed good  smart filmmakers ( and i still think they are )  theyll rebound just fine .  even after that happens  though  ill still consider  me  myself & irene  to be a high-caliber misfire .  , NEGwesley snipes is a master of selecting bad action roles .  murder at 1600  u . s . marshals  money train  drop zone  boiling point  and the ultimate camp film - passenger 57 .  the art of war is another entry in this very ugly and unique category .  ultimately  it is little more than a ridiculous action film with a plot as believable as the warren report  ugly violence that would have made peckinpah cringe  and terrible acting by b-list actors like michael biehn and anne archer .  oddly  it feels like the undiscovered sequel to another snipes  masterpiece   rising sun .  the movie revolves around the convenient story of a special un operative caught up in a secret murder conspiracy involving a chinese ambassador  the chinese triad brotherhood  a rich chinese businessman ( played by ? that bad guy from rising sun  cary-hiroyuki tagawa ) a chinese un interpreter  and  inexplicably  donald sutherland .  the film ends with more confusion than a boatload of chinese immigrants trying to register at ellis island .  or should i say the film ends with the most blatant ripoff of both the matrix and all of john woos hong kong films combined .  i am really at a loss to figure out why wesley snipes had the gumption to not only star in this action dud but also act as one of the producers of the film .  i usually enjoy snipes movies - though his dramatic roles better show off his creativity as an actor than the flashiness of his action films .  simply  i am amazed by the how inane the script was  filled with terrible cliches and extremely violent action sequences .  director christian duguay ( screamers ) has a strange attraction to the viciousness of violent acts -- showing splattering brains  people impaled with broken shards of glass  and lots of gargling and gagging as blood sprays everywhere .  it also sickens me to know that oliver stone  one of the greatest directors working today  had his hand in producing this monstrosity .  i guess snipes sold stone on the conspiracy angle and stone chose not to read the script  watch the dailies  be involved in casting  or anything else -- or else hed be filing a court order to remove his name from the credits .  its also seems evident that with the russkies as our new bosom buddies and the middle eastern terrorist angle being beaten to death in the last couple of years that the new international enemies in hollywood are the communist chinese .  im sure over the next couple of months  even more  chinese conspiracy/martial-arts action flicks  are going to be popping up in your local multiplex .  hopefully they wont include wesley snipes .  , NEGsenseless is a prime example of what can happen when you try to push a one-joke concept a bit too far .  director penelope spheeris is no stranger to this  having subjected audiences before to such tortures as the beverly hillbillies .  marlon wayans stars as darryl witherspoon  a college senior vying for a lucrative job at a prominent brokerage .  however  he lacks the advantages of his chief opposition  scott thorpe ( david spade  in the smarmy sort of role he can deliver in his sleep ) : an athletic record  sponsorship by a fraternity  and  most of all  a wealthy family to back him up .  in fact  darryl has to work at four jobs simply to make ends meet .  but there may be a light at the end of that tunnel .  he signs up as a human guinea pig in a neurological experiment run by the universitys dr . wheedon ( brad dourif ) .  as a result  his senses are magnified tenfold .  using his newfound abilities  he sets himself in complete pursuit of the job ( unaware that there may be some disadvantageous side-effects to having super senses ) .  naturally  marlon wayans plays this comedy at full throttle  giving jim carrey-ish amounts of physical humor .  the problem is  aside from a few genuinely inspired bits  theres not much thats funny here .  the film has its one central gag  and pads out the rest of its length with rather obvious lowbrow humor .  there obviously wasnt much thought put into the plot .  the entire job selection process is completely ridiculous .  i mean  why the emphasis on extra-curricular activities if the entire job is going to come down to a single-elimination quiz anyhow ?  and is this the only job being offered to economics majors this semester ?  to give it credit  senseless does try to create a secondary joke with darryls roommate  tim laflour ( matthew lillard ) .  apparently  he is supposed to be faddish  but the film never does anything with him  leaving him in a piercing phase throughout the movie .  his  intervention  scenes with darryl  however  do provide a rare  and welcome  laugh .  and then theres the love interest which is always pathetically tacked onto comedies like this one .  in this case  the object of darryls amor is janice ( tamara taylor )  a fellow student who wont have anything to do with darryl until he gains his super-senses .  needless to say  the romance is completely extraneous  and adds little to the film .  this is a film that desperately needed something else .  be that a good plot  more jokes ( or simply funnier ones )  or a strong character or two  anything would have helped senseless get off the ground .  as it is  all the manic exuberant mugging in the world cant help marlon wayans get this one off the ground .  , NEGi came to an epiphany while watching the bachelor  an innocuous-enough-on-the-surface romantic comedy .  its not the sort of film in which one would expect to achieve any moment of clarity  but there it was nonetheless .  i sat there watching this marshmallow of a movie unfold when suddenly i realized what is so ridiculously wrong with the entire romantic comedy genre circa 1999 .  in a word  its the same thing thats wrong with so many movies circa 1999 : writing .  more to the point  its the refusal to acknowledge that characterizations matter when youre telling a story about a relationship .  the bachelor is merely the latest in a long line of films where were expected to get dewy-eyed over any pairing of attractive  pleasant people just because theyre attractive and pleasant .  in this particular case  attractive and pleasant exhibit a is jimmy shannon ( chris odonnell )  a single guy who has been watching his friends slowly but surely sucked into marriage .  its a scary notion for jimmy  even though he dearly loves attractive and pleasant exhibit b anne ( renee zellweger )  his girlfriend of three years .  convinced despite his reservations that its time to  sh * t or get off the pot   jimmy proposes to anne -- very badly .  anne refuses  which leaves jimmy in a very odd position when his eccentric grandfather ( peter ustinov ) dies and leaves a very specific video will .  jimmy stands to inhereit $100 million if he is married by 6 : 05 p . m . on his 30th birthday  stays married for 10 years and produces a child .  there are only a couple of minor problems : 1 ) jimmys 30th birthday is the next day ; 2 ) anne is nowhere to be found  meaning jimmy has to find another willing bride from among his many ex-girlfriends .  its a wacky  brewsters millions-esque premise ( acknowledged as such in one of the films better  more self-aware lines of dialogue )  the kind where a shallow and materialistic guy learns what really matters .  at least that would be the case if jimmy werent already a world-class altruist .  screenwriter steve cohen slides into the story an even more draconian condition in the will : if jimmy doesnt get married  not only will he lose all the money  but the family billiard table buisness will be sold out from under him  costing hudreds of jobs .  from the outset  jimmys motivation isnt cash ; its the livelihoods of his devoted employees .  its almost embarrassing for his marital misgivings to play a role in the bachelors plot development .  by any human standard  the guy is impossibly selfless .  and thats the essence of the gutlessness endemic to films like the bachelor -- the fear of giving the characters flaws to overcome on their way to happiness .  theres never any tension between the two star-crossed lovers  because theres no sense that anything remotely significant is at stake .  the blandly nice odonnell couldnt pull off a randy cad if he tried  so the filmmakers dont even let him ; zellwegers anne may have issues with her sickeningly affectionate parents as an impossible standard to live up to  but no one dares make her anything but the woman ( lightly ) wronged .  and forget about seeing enough of jimmy and anne together to feel invested in their potential reconciliation .  the parade of sit-com set pieces had better be damned funny  since theyre all that stands between us and a blissfully sweet foregone conclusion .  ill admit a couple of those set pieces are amusing  including ustinovs rantings about procreation and a restaurant full-to-bursting with men popping questions and champagne corks .  far more of them are either tedious or downright ghastly  like the shudder-inducing sight of brooke shields as an icy fortune-hunter or the hideous collection of stereotypes when hundreds of potential brides gather in a church .  youre never going to get too many raucous belly laughs from a film like the bachelor  but thats not the real problem .  nor is it the real problem that you know exactly the kind of warm-n-fuzzy conclusion its leading up to .  the problem are a beginning and middle that are equally warm-n-fuzzy -- theres no spark  no energy  no humanity .  its an emotional pudding guaranteed not to offend any consumers digestions .  weve reached a point where our proxies for cinematic romantic wish fulfillment dont even have a pulse .  the bachelor is love among the mannequins .  , NEGare you like me ?  do you get annoyed seeing people talk on their cellulars in public places  shouting out loud  not giving a ratts ass about anyone around them  and basically just wallowing in their own self-importance ?  well if you are  than you will most likely agree with my rating of this film since it basically features a trio of annoying ladies bickering away on the phone for an hour and a half . . . only to make up and hug in the end .  aaaaaaaahhhh . . .  plot : three grown-up sisters living their own separate lives  begin to re-establish their communication lines when their dear old dad falls ill .  critique : this would be a good movie if it wasnt for the fact that its got very little to say  features uncaring people sharing annoying phone conversations  is chockfull of bad acting moments and provides less emotional satisfaction than any third-rate after-school special .  and im being nice !  how junk like this gets made is beyond me  but happy am i that the ephron sisters will finally be dealt a professional blow  considering the regurgitation level of their material had just about reached its limit .  the only true emotional moment demonstrated between meg ryans character and her dad in this film is when he hugs her and swings her around at a christmas tree lot .  wow . . . how  deep .  of course  the same christmas tune thats played in every ephron flick chimes out in the background  while characters continue to build  bonds  among one another by making reference to old  quaint movies or movie stars .  stop me . . . im  gonna cry again !  this film is a mess .  the characters are boring and irritating to watch  the plot has something to do with three selfish sisters talking on the phone a whole lot  kind of liking their father ( but not really ) and then finally realizing the error of their ways  while sharing an  emotional  moment about movie stars from the 50s .  admittedly  i was not expecting much from a film whose television trailer features meg ryan screaming every two seconds and a big dog rolling its eyes  but even i was surprised at the level of ineptitude when it came to some of the acting efforts put forth in this film .  meg did fine as the sister who cries a lot  looking as adorable as ever  but someone please put lisa kudrow inside a permanent home of limited range  cause this woman basically is that very same character that she plays in every single movie/tv show that shes in .  enough already !  and diane keaton mustve spent more time thinking about her role behind the camera in this one  cause her acting was amateurish at best .  neither one convinced in  emotional  scenes .  granted  they gave walter matthau the best lines in the film and thats probably where my rating of three points comes from .  all in all  this movie is not funny ( unless youre one to chuckle at train wrecks )  provides zero drama ( unless you consider loud phone conversations moving )  generates absolutely no emotion ( although i did tear up when meg hugged a coffee machine ) and ends on a perfectly pretentious note (  oh no  please dont get any flour on my donna karan dress ! ) .  ugh .  i suggest that all ladies take their husbands/boyfriends to see this movie if they are pissed off at them about something !  thatll teach em to mess with you !  oh and incidentally  mrs . joblo also likened this movie to a piece of cow dung flailing in the wind  so there !  then again . . . maybe  youll like it .   : )  , NEGi have a confession .  even though i am a movie junkie-i saw eye of the beholder and yet i still watch movies-ive never seen any of the original godzillas .   ( note that godzilla 2000 is not a sequel to the u . s . godzilla released in 1998 ; its the american release of a 1999 godzilla flick called gojira ni-sen mireniamu . )  so  part of me was excited as i drove to the local multiplex to see godzilla 2000-the latest entry in an almost 50-year old franchise .  this was a long-awaited treat .  i was expecting a goofy good time  complete with bad dubbing  science fair level sets and a ludicrous plot line .  the last thing i expected was for the movie to be so ? boring .  i can only imagine what the theatre full of kids i saw this with felt .  you do get all of the  so bad theyre good  traits so normally associated with the franchise .  but you have to sit through a snoozer plot that has the organization of a rorschach blot .  its a deal i wasnt willing to accept .  hiroshi kashiwabara and waturu mimuras script crams in way too many details  and in many cases  fails to follow up on them .  the maneuver is not only disconcerting  but gives the movie a permanent logy  weighty feel .  godzilla starts off destroying power plants and then just stops .  was it a whim ?  a bold political statement ?  i dont know .  its foe  an ancient meteor that looks like prudentials logo  doesnt just fight the beast from the far east .  no  its got to have life-saving powers  a plot to erase  the data  from japan  a desire to clone and the ability to become a spaceship and then some kind of tentacled space creature .  theres a battle between the head of the godzilla prediction unit ( takehiro murata ) and a slimy government official ( hiroshi abe ) over the handling of godzilla  and personal issues .  and then theres the plucky news photographer and blah  blah  blah .  its like watching magnolia all over again-except without the good writing  keen sociological insight and aimee mann songs .  what a waste .  when the talking and the plot points stop hurtling at you  godzilla 2000 does the job-its entertaining and goes down easy .  the action scenes are cheesy in their grandeur though a little sluggish .  the dubbing is nice and awful  with murata sounding like hes in constant need of a cough drop .  as for the dialogue  one line summarizes the goofiness factor :  did anyone see that flying rock go by ?   this movie also marked the first time since the three stooges that ive heard the word  imbecile  used in casual conversation .  though the summer movie season is drying up and godzilla 2000 has its moments  i wouldnt take kids to see it .  theyll probably end up asking more questions than charlie rose .  , NEGcapsule : five friends at a stag party are involved in the accidental killing of a prostitute .  the cover-up attempt becomes a monster that eats up the friends  two wives and several innocent bystanders .  this was a real audience pleaser at toronto  but it did not do much for me .    low 0 ( -4 to +4 )  - directed by peter berg who acted in the last seduction and copland .  - five buddies go on a stag outing to las vegas while cameron diaz works through the logistics of her upcoming wedding to one of them .  one of the buddies accidentally kills a prostitute .  - several people with no moral compass .  they started out with a simple  innocent little cocaine party ( ! ) and by accident look what happened .  they have one moral person among them ( daniel stern )  and one totally amoral person ( christian slater ) .  it is more selfish to let the amoral lead  so they do .  - this film is strange  but not really funny or biting .  black comedy should actually be funny as well as strange .  there should be some element of satire .  the satire is missing here .  i did not find myself laughing here either .  what we have is a strange crime tale .  - one just does not care what happens to these people .  - the same idea of people just getting themselves in deeper and deeper has been done frequently .  if this film is popular it is just bringing a familiar plot to a new generation .  - it begins like diner ( particularly with daniel stern ) and ends up like an extended horror/crime comic book .  - there are several logical holes in script .  if a security man goes to investigate a complaint and disappears  wouldnt the guests he was investigating be the first suspects ?  someone framed for a crime in the way shown would be judged innocent after minimal forensic detective work .   ( i am desperately trying to avoid making this a spoiler . )  - popular and situation ethics get a real slamming .  - some acting of grief is hammy and overdone .  more yelling than humor .  , NEGwhat hath kevin williamson wrought ?  while the horror movie revival spurred on by his _scream_ has yielded a few decent entries in the genre--_i_know_what_you_did_last_summer_  _halloween : _h20_  and _scream_2_ --it must be noted that williamson himself had a hand in the writing of those films .  those williamson-less post-_scream_ efforts  among them _wishmaster_ and the recent _disturbing_behavior_  have been frightening all right--frighteningly  insultingly _bad_ .  add to that list _urban_legend_  which takes a promising premise and runs it through a predictable meat grinder of idiocy .  the influence of williamson on screenwriter silvio horta is clear in two key areas .  first  the opening sequence  like that of _scream_  is an extended set piece detailing the singular murder that gets the proverbial ball rolling .  this sequence  in which pendleton college coed michelle mancini ( natasha gregson wagner ) is decapitated while driving  also reveals the other obviously williamson-esque touch : the killers look .  dressed in a large hooded parka  wielding an axe  the killer bears more than a passing resemblance to the _i_know . . . _fisherman   sans the hook .  one thing horta does not borrow from williamson  however  is the intriguing premise .  students at pendleton are being killed by way of urban legends--those contemporary bits of  mythology  passed from person to person  group to group  year to year that become so embedded in the social consciousness .  it hardly matters if they are true or not  such as the tall tale that mikey from the life cereal commercials died from a fatal combination of pop rocks and pepsi ( he didnt ) .  michelle  slain by the  killer lurking in the backseat  of lore  is but the first to fall prey to an urban legend come true ; as the body count rises  fellow pendleton student natalie ( alicia witt ) suspects not only a link between the murders  but a personal link to her past as well .  the setup shows promise  but the story never takes off  due in large part to horta and the director  the aptly named jamie blanks  who fires round afer round of his namesake in terms of suspense and scares .  too many of the would-be shocks are fakeouts reliant on bombastic music cues  and the films chase scenes are riddled with the cliches that _scream_ tried to subvert  like screaming damsels knowingly running themselves into dead ends when they should--and could--run out the front door .  but that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cliches ; theres also the climactic villain confession  in which a contrived and way-too-convenient motive is revealed  not to mention the credit card opening up the locked door trick  which is a cliche in any film genre .  banks and hortas ( intentional ) attempts at humor are also lame ; the fact that the best gags are lazy  in-jokey references to the other credits of co-stars joshua jackson and rebecca gayheart says a lot about the imagination of their humor .  some laughs are also had when the rather predictable identity of the killer is revealed  but im not so sure if some of the more hilarious things about it were meant to be so .  the filmmakers dont get much help from their onscreen talent .  i was far from a fan of bland _i_know . . . _  starlet jennifer love hewitt  but id talke her any day ove the dreadfully stiff and uncharismatic witt  whose inept attempts at emoting were often met with laughter ; witt has a pefect foil in her equally pesence-challenged leading man  jared leto .  _dawsons_creek_ star jackson mugs his way thorugh a glorified cameo ; gayheart displays all the depth and range of  well  a noxzema spokeswoman ; and robert englund lends the film little more than his freddy krueger pedigree as a folklore professor .  granted  the cast is hampered by their material .  loretta devine  who has done some fine work in films such as _waiting_to_exhale_  is saddled with the ridiculous role of a pam grier-worshiping campus security guard .  the recently resuscitated horror genre cannot rely on the efforts one man--namely  kevin williamson--to stay alive .  if other filmmakers continue to make such shoddy product as _urban_legend_  the genre looks to once again go the way of screen slashers many victims .  , NEGwarner brothers has scored another marketing coup .  the one-two punch was started in the summer  with the release of batman forever .  trailers for ace ventura 2 were bundled with the bat  ensuring that every jim carrey fan in the free world would know about the impending sequel .  carrey went on to win raves as the riddler and the ever-wise warner chose halloween as the release date for the video ( $11 . 99 at wal-mart ) ; a mere two weeks before carreys return in this marketwise  but misfired comedy .  ace ventura : when nature calls is a painful reminder of just how grating the rubber-faced comic can be when allowed to perform within an uncontrolled environment .  he may have been brilliant under the direction of joel schumacher  in batman forever  but  here  left to his own devices  carrey quickly wears out his welcome .  the opening sequence is by far the best--an amusing spoof of cliffhanger  with ace performing a mountain rescue of a stranded raccoon .   ( you can guess what happens to mr . paws .  hint : it sounds like splat . )  the plot quickly shifts to a temple in the himalayas  and then to not-so-darkest africa  where ace is on the case of a missing white bat .  with his hair and limbs both wildly askew  carrey flies through his routine in about thirty minutes .  the rest of the film is just more of the same .  sure  the plots linear  and the production values solid  but where is the scripted humor to support carreys sloppy slathering ?  writer and director steve oderkerk provides precious few set-ups .  instead  carrey just mugs away  playing for the camera even when most of it isnt funny .  the better gags have been shown in the ads  though a bit with ace emerging buck-naked from the backside of a mechanical rhino is something to see .  though an arguable improvement over the original  ace ventura : when nature calls is still a snooze for anyone over the age of ten .  the script is virtually devoid of wit .  tribal mask jokes ?  jerry lewis cameos ?  forget it .  if anything  the inexplicable presence of simon callow ( four weddings and a funeral ) and bob gunton ( the shawshank redemption ) suggests that working with carrey is the classical actors ultimate challenge .  just how long * can * they keep a straight face ?  , NEGsynopsis : wealthy cuban landowner luis ( banderas ) gets more than he bargained for when he sends away for an american bride .  not only does his new wife turn out to be the beautiful julia ( jolie )  she also harbours a secret past of dubious merit .  soon  julia has absconded with both luis fortune and his heart  and as he pursues his wife through the cuban underworld  luis begins to realise that  for him  there is no turning back .  review : given the absurdism of its would-be plot  its unlikely that  original sin  could have been turned into a reputable piece of filmmaking  regardless of writer  director or stars .  this is  at its heart  b-movie junk : a lurid melodrama which appeals to neither the brain nor the heart but to the nether regions .  that said   original sin  could at least have become enjoyable junk had the filmmakers embraced its trashiness and indulged in it .  instead  cristofer seems to have mistaken this for a serious production  and directs it as such .  the result is a vapid  uninteresting morass of obvious crosses and double crosses  as likely to incite a yawn as a thrill .  consider the initial sex scene between banderas and jolie : brightly-lit and mostly filmed from above  it looks like an excerpt from an amateur soft porn show .  cristofer doesnt even manage to capture the allure of cuba ; instead of portraying his setting as a steamy  sensuous island paradise  it appears bland and lifeless .  at least banderas and jolie manage to inspire some interest ; there are hints at times that they want to have more fun with the script  but arent being given the chance .  the same cannot be said of jane  whose billy is nebbish and transparent .  also unwise is the jolie framing sequence  which practically gives away the films denouement .  , NEGwhen a pair of films from the same director gets released just three weeks apart  it could mean one of two things : that the recently overworked individual is due for a well-deserved rest  or that either of these movies has been sitting in a studio safe for a while and the timing is merely a coincidence .  the latters the case with john mctiernan and  the thirteenth warrior   which finally hits theatres a year and counting after its original spring 98 opening - and fast on the heels of mctiernans  the thomas crown affair  remake  a flick that got good reviews .  you dont have to believe superstitions to wager a guess that  thirteenth  wont be so lucky .  reportedly shelved following skirmishes between mctiernan and producer michael crichton  whose  eaters of the dead  novel provides  warrior  s source ( and its initial title )  this messy melange of culture-clash drama and brutal warfare feels empty and sluggish - sorta like  braveheart  without any of the passion .  but the bloodshed certainly remains : theres enough carnage on display here to satisfy those in search of purely visceral thrills  though please note that the admittedly pungent battle sequences containing all this death and dismemberment alternate with talky passages interminable in their dullness .  these circa-10th century clashes involve a roving band of cannibalistic creatures capable of decapitating opponents with their bare hands and a dozen norse soldiers out to stop them from terrorizing the viking countryside .  the good guys are loud  crude  often unintelligible and - judging from their highly icky hygiene habits -- pretty smelly to boot  which makes them perfect foils for the dignified arab ambassador ( antonio banderas ) who tags along quite reluctantly .  theyre also so hard to tell apart that it hardly matters when a few of them meet violent demises .  youll wince  youll groan  youll grouse   havent we seen this guy killed twice before ?   banderas stands confused amidst the chaos  partaking mostly from a distance as savages in darth maul facepaint and draped in the latest animal-skin fashion run amok .  hes not the hero - his soulful eyes and lean build dont exactly herald a champion of shwarzenegger proportions - and  the thirteenth warrior  wisely doesnt pretend he is  allowing his foreign and physically imposing co-stars to step into the spotlight when the going gets rough .  let the characters interaction sans swords and shields  however  and theres still a struggle - for the audience to follow or even care about the story .  it isnt the end until audiences have witnessed a half-baked romance  murky political intrigue  veteran actor omar sharif (  funny girl  ) dropping by in a cameo role and a climactic  indiana jones and the temple of doom  -esque chase through the villains underground lair .  all this clutter receives stunning visual treatment courtesy of cinematographer peter menzies jr .  but the collaboration between  die hard  -helmer mctiernan and  jurrasic park  -creator crichton should have yielded more than sumptuous sights  graphic action and unintentionally telling moments .  heard during  the thirteenth warrior  s final scene : a dog whimpering .  how appropriate .  , NEG  the red violin  is a cold  sterile feature that leaves you uninvolved and detached .  its a movie that seems almost clinical  as it traces the 300-plus-years history of the legendary musical instrument of the title .  opening in the 17th century  the story shows how violin-maker nicolo bussotti created the instrument as a gift for his unborn son .  but when tragedy strikes  the violin becomes the personification of its makers grief .  from there the violin comes into the hands of an orphaned child prodigy at an austrian monastery .  again  tragedy strikes as the child is struck down at the moment of his triumph .  we follow the violin through the centuries as it finds a home in england and in maos communist china before being discovered by expert charles morritz ( samuel l . jackson )  who mounts a painstaking investigation to prove its authenticity .  the violin becomes morritzs obsession  just as it is for all those who converge on a montreal auction house to bid on it .  morritz  however  is the only one who knows the secret of the instrument and can understand and appreciate its creators intention .    the red violin  could have been a touching  inspirational story  as soaring as a beethoven symphony .  however director francois girard fails to make any emotional connection with the viewer .  here is a story that could have made use of various camera angles and lighting to heighten its impact .  girard  for some unknown reason  uses mostly master shots  keeping his camera - and thus us - at a distance .  we get no feel for the miracle that is the violin .  its resonance  its purity of sound are not emphasized enough to make an impression .  nor are any of the performances memorable .  its as if girard wanted all his actors to play second fiddle to his violin .    the red violin  promises much  but delivers little .  it is dull at times  a bit pretentious and a might murky .  the movies music soars over its story and performers .  and that is its only saving grace .  , NEGthere have been merchant-ivory costume dramas with more of a pulse than  the mod squad   a self-consciously  hip  cinematic rendering of the old tv series still looked upon fondly by so many baby-boomers .  well  said  squad  certainly wont be a pleasant viewing experience for them or anybody else  maybe even the teen target audience the movie has been geared towards .  a contemporary take on this decidedly 70s show doesnt exactly seem unwarranted  but one wonders if the mold it accumulated while waiting on the shelf didnt transform into a full-blown case of botulism .  how curious that the film begins by defining both mod and squad  insisting that the latter is a group of people working together and then contradicting this definition by keeping its titular trio apart for a sizeable chunk of the running time .  they are julie  pete and linc  reformed delinquents working undercover for the lapd ( exposition put out of the way so fast that youre likely to be lost from the opening moments on )  and they are respectively played by claire danes  giovanni ribisi and omar epps  talented actors each deserving of better than this .  their plight involves standard cop-corruption stuff  as our would-be protagonists catch wind of an internal cover-up after their superior ( reliable dennis farina  one of the best things here and gone so quickly ) gets killed and framed for drug trafficking .  they pout a lot and eventually get cracking to expose this convoluted conspiracy using surveillance tactics that would impress the hardy boys and linda tripp but few others .  when youre supposed to be asking   whats going to happen next ?    youll instead entertain thoughts like  who are these people and why should i care ?   or  arent thrillers supposed to contain thrills ?   not that danes  epps and ribisi dont give it a shot .  danes can do the troubled teen thing in her sleep  as evidenced by  my so-called life   but shes saddled with a mysterious-boyfriend ( josh brolin ) subplot so see-through you begin to seriously question her so-called intelligence .  ditto for ribisis (  saving private ryan  ) looney loose cannon  though at least he performs with a wild-and-crazy vigor that occasionally demands attention .  but epps - poor epps .  epps (  higher learning  ) is so short-changed hes reduced to literally waiting around for a bad guy to chase him .  all this sloppiness can be attributed to the screenwriters  one of whom  scott silver  is also the director .  they must think that if they dress up their stupid story in such spiffy trappings ( the look of the film is really quite impressive )  itll somehow pay off  but this  mod squad  plods anyway .  characters are non-existent ; present are just some good-looking young things modeling cool levis and cooler attitudes .  plot hardly escapes confusing convention .  and the one genre element youd think would be show up in generous portions - a few nifty explosions  some fights  any kind of action whatsoever - only rarely makes it to this dull gabfest .  all those quick to put down last months inept but serviceable  my favorite martian  update need to take a step back .  heres a small-to-big-screen translation that really shouldve stayed in its former incarnation   mod  or not .  , NEGready to rumble is not a masterpiece in film ; i have a problem even regarding it as a film .  its more of a show  a big commercial for ted turners world championship wrestling ( wcw ) .  the movie is almost entirely about and fully showcases the wrestlers of the wcw like diamond dallas page  goldberg  and sting .  the story is very minimal and basic .  there are these two guys  gordy ( david arquette ) and sean ( scott caan ) .  they are two twenty-something wrestling fans from wyoming .  when they go to a live event for the big match up  there favorite wrestler jimmy king ( oliver platt ) is defeated and his career is announced to be over by the mean commissioner titus ( joe pantoliano ) .  gordy and sean decide to go on a quest to find jimmy and bring him back to the top and defeat the evil titus plans .  on the way  they meet some people  have some fun  and clean up some port-o-potties .  sounds great huh  well its not .  the movie makes many attempts at humor  only a few of them work .  the jokes that make you laugh  however  do not outnumber the films many duds .  there is a funny repertoire between arquette and a convenience store cashier played by ahmet zappa .  the cashier is very mean to arquette so arquette dreams of ways to get him back .  i especially enjoyed one version in which they have a wrestling match and arquettes tag team partner is macho man randy savage .  they wrestle between the aisles knocking over cans and getting body slammed on the floor .  the other good part of the film is the sexual confrontation between arquette and rose mcgowan .  mcgowan plays sasha the head nitro girl  the cheerleaders of the wcw .  she becomes attracted to gordy and they have some nice  funny scenes together especially one scene in which arquette calls mcgowans breasts foreign objects than punches her directly into the face .  now what didnt work in this movie ?  that would be the rest of it .  the flick was filled with stupid potty humor about farts and toilets .  the two lead characters work for a port-o-potty cleaning company and when they crash the truck  the excrements spill all over the road .  its not funny ; its pathetic and brainless .  the film is giving homage to how blindly faithful of their wrestlers but not all wrestling fans are that way .  i watch it for entertainment and i would think some people would take offense to what is said throughout the movie .  the main characters in the film actually get to wrestle  like that would happen to any fan  especially to 2 that stalk a wrestler and sneak him back onto set .  also  i wondered how they got into the backstage so easily ; they just walked right in .  i like wrestling .  i watch it at home and laugh .  its continuously funny and has great characters otherwise i wouldnt watch it .  this movie wasnt even funny or fun to watch like the wrestling on tv .  the only fun i had in the movie was pointing out the wrestlers i knew .  the funny thing was that many of the wcw featured wrestlers like saturn and chris benoit have left wcw for more money but are still featured in the film prominently .  the movie was too dim-witted to be funny .  it is possibly the most useless and under-developed film ever .  a recent film in this genre of fans would be the kiss fan film  detroit rock city .  that movie was interesting  well done and continuously funny unlike this film .  the acting was good plus the jokes had humor and made you laugh .  now that the scream trilogy is over  arquette has nothing else to do so he has to do crap like this and be a spokesman in those dumb 1-800-call-att ads .  at least he has a hot wife in courtney cox .  hes in the funny parts of the film but there arent enough to make him look good .  the music was bad also feature such overplayed tunes as kid rocks  bawitdaba  and  cowboy  .  martin landau has a great cameo as a classic  hard-nosed wrestling trainer named sal that whips the king back into shape to regain his throne .  script is important to a film but this piece of crap could have been made with a couple of scribblings on a napkin .  a fan of the wrestlers who are featured in the film probably wrote it .  at times the movie even tries to show wrestling as real .  the wrestlers form alliances  go to peoples houses and beat them up .  its utterly ridiculous .  the whole film was a wasteful  dumfounding experience .  the movie was made to pay homage to the fans  telling them things that made wrestling  not the wrestlers .  the wrestlers are making more money to make a movie to thank the fans for begin fans by paying 5 dollars to see a potty-humor movie .  the wcw sucks and this movie is just a pathetic two-hour commercial to watch it .  if youre going to watch wrestling watch wwf  its actually entertaining .  the wrestling is betters  theyre funnier  more diverse  and have better entrance themes .  oh and the girls are hotter .  is this what movies have become  2 hour-long commercials that you have to pay to see ?  dont waste your money .  , NEGwyatt earp details thirty-five years in the life of same from around 1865 to 1900 .  after seeing the movie speed twice recently  i kept thinking that i was seeing wyatts life pass before my eyes in real time .  this movie was boring  slow  boring  and slow .  there were a few scenes that tried to be great scenes that tried too hard and just fell flat .  the script happily woman-bashes but also tries to sound like an 80s movie .  they cannot have it both ways .    i now pronounce you husband and wife .   sure  they said that in the 1800s .    entrepreneur .   sure .  every bit of male-ego-stroking dialogue that wyatts third wife speaks to him made me sick to listen to it .    oh  the script was written by two men ?     no kidding !   the movie is torture to sit through .  the scenery is boring .  the fades were either awkward or cliche or to self important .  can you say poor editing ?  everyone looks ugly in this movie .  when you shoot people from under their chins  they look like they have double chins .  kevin costner has never looked worse .  he should sue .  he looks like he gained the 43 pounds that dennis quaid lost .  dennis quaid is marvelous .  if you have to see this movie just for his performance  go into the theatre at the movies halfway mark .  doc holliday ( quaids character ) shows up at about the 90-minute mark .  gene hackman is very good .  is he in the credits ?  i dont remember seeing his name .  mare winningham makes the best of a small role as wyatts second wife .  annabeth gish is good as wyatts first wife .  i though that jamie gertz played wyatts third wife  but i later heard that her name is joanna going .  she looks great but her dialogue sucks .  she also seems way to young for costner .  costner seems way to old for 90% of this movie .  in his first scene he is supposed to be about 19 years old .  yeah  right .  catherine ohara and jobeth williams are always good and totally wasted here .  this is the worst movie that i have seen in years .  the last action hero was better that this .  go see maverick if you want to see a western .  bullets for dennis quaids performance only .  , NEGdavid schwimmer ( from the television series  friends  ) stars as a sensitive ( and slightly neurotic ) single guy who gets more than he expected from the grieving mother ( barbara hershey ) of a classmate he cant remember .  hello mrs . robinson !  though quite cute as a romantic comedy  the pallbearer is paced like a funeral march .  the characters act  react  and interact at half-speed  making for one * excruciatingly * long sit .   ( and whats with the dreary lighting ? )  co-writer/director matt reeves brings some snap to the storys midsection ; the film briefly comes to life when our hero attempts to resolve his feelings for * another * classmate ( a very appealing gwyneth paltrow ) .  by this time  though  most viewers will have either fled or fallen asleep .  those tough souls who stay with it can marvel at the sleepy-eyed schwimmer  a hound dog with a head cold  who can go for over an hour without ever changing his expression .  , NEG  saving silverman  is a good example of a good comedy gone bad .  as a love story it is good  however as a comedy it falls flat on its face .  i think throughout the short 90 minutes i laughed a total of seven times . . . and  those were just chuckles at the most !  the movie doesnt have the oomph to make it a great movie  and doesnt have the script to make it a funny movie .  wayne lefessier ( steven zahn )  j . d . mcnugent ( jack black )  and darren silverman ( jason biggs ) have grown up all their lives together  they have been best friends forever and vow to stay close till the end .  while in a bar after doing a show with their band  based on their love of neil diamond  darren meets a young woman named judith ( amanda peet ) whom he instantly falls for .  wayne and j . d . however think differently and when judith tells darren that he can never see his friends again  its up to wayne and j . d . to try and begin saving silverman .  the performances are topnotch and surprisingly  they are what keep the movie afloat .  jason biggs right off the flop  loser  does an ok job playing silverman  but he is stale and flat at times .  steve zahn is perfect in the role of wayne lefessier  and even though the movie is about silverman  lefessier is really the main character and the narrator of the movie itself .  jack black is well jack black  and he does an all right job as j . d . but he isnt as funny as he has been in the past .  amanda peet plays the ultimate bitch as judith  and neil diamond plays neil diamond ( hes better at singing than acting ) .  anyway the performances in the film are good  but its too bad the script isnt .  speaking of script  hank nelkans choppy script is not only badly written  but not funny enough even for an episode of sesame street .  the trailer for the movie  as with most movies gives away everything that happens in the movie  especially the funniest parts .  somewhere  saving silverman  was meant to be a good movie  and it could have been  but alas in the end it wasnt .  dennis dugans direction is all right  he adds a few directorial touches here and there  nothing special being a simple comedy .    saving silverman  is a perfectly bad movie in more ways than one .  it has a great cast  a good director and a sweet story . . . its  just too bad it has a bad script and is all together a bad movie .  , NEGone of my brothers favorite movies is h . b . halickis 1974 cult flick  gone is sixty seconds   one of the best products of the car-chase genre that provided drive-in fare during the 1970s .  chase pics had more tire squeals than dialogue  but they had a strong visceral appeal .  although it boasts a bigger budget and familiar stars  the remake of  gone in sixty seconds  is relatively weak and dull .  randall  memphis  raines ( nicolas cage ) is a retired car thief who runs a go-cart track .  he got out of crime so that his younger brother kip ( giovanni ribisi ) would not take up boosting cars .  however  kip became a thief anyway  and now hes in big trouble .  kip promised to deliver fifty luxury and sports cars to gangster raymond calitri ( christopher eccleston ) by the end of the week .  calitri expects memphis to fulfill kips bargain ; if he doesnt come through  kip dies .  memphis gathers his old crew ( angelina jolie  robert duvall  will patton  chi mcbride  and vinnie jones )  and kip brings his boys ( t . j .  cross  william lee scott  scott caan  and james duval ) .  as if calitri breathing down their necks wasnt bad enough  the team is pursued by a cop ( delroy lindo ) whos still ticked off that he never busted memphis and by a rival gangster ( rap star master p ) who wants to take over calitris clients .  watching  gone   i discovered that stealing fifty cars is not any more interesting than stealing one .  maybe thats why the first forty-nine are fairly easy  and the thrills are saved for  eleanor   a 1967 shelby gto  a model that has always eluded memphis .  but the big chase doesnt live up to the long wait .  i had high hopes for  gone  because it is director dominic senas second film .    kalifornia   his 1993 debut  was a brilliant study in the relationship between violence and its audience .  in that movie sena took a simple thriller plot ( a couple gives a serial killer a ride ) and successfully endowed it with deeper significance .  in  gone  he seems to be aiming for a drama about two brothers who cant communicate with each other  but that goal just doesnt mesh with this plot .    gone  either takes itself too seriously or not seriously enough .  its not light enough to be fun  or mean enough to be intense .  this chaser has more dialogue than tire squeals but is none the better for it .  the lack of action is a waste of the premise  which should have challenged the filmmakers to create the most spectacular car chases ever .  the weak script is a waste of a talented cast .  in a  newsweek  interview last year  sean penn blasted his old pal nic cage for making bad movies .  much as i like cage  for every good picture he does (  leaving las vegas    bringing out the dead  )  there are two major stinkers (  snake eyes    con air    8mm    city of angels  ) .  that ratio is probably better than what a lot of his peers can boast  but cage has real talent .  its a shame to waste it in glitzy  superficial tripe like  gone in 60 seconds .   , NEGsteve martin is one of the funniest men alive .  if you can take that as a true statement  then your disappointment at this film will equal mine .  martin can be hilarious  creating some of the best laugh-out-loud experiences that have ever taken place in movie theaters .  you wont find any of them here .  the old television series that this is based on has its moments of humor and wit .  bilko ( and the name isnt an accident ) is the head of an army motor pool group  but his passion is his schemes .  every episode involves the sergeant and his men in one or another hair-brained plan to get rich quick while outwitting the officers of the base .    mchales navy  s granddaddy .  thats the idea behind this movie too  but the difference is that  as far-fetched and usually goofy as the television series was  it was funny .  there is not one laugh in the film .  the re-make retains the goofiness  but not the entertainment .  everything is just too clean .  it was obviously made on a hollywood back lot and looks every bit like it .  it all looks brand new  even the old beat-up stuff .  martin is remarkably small in what should have been a bigger than life role .  in the original  phil silvers played the huckster with a heart of gold and more than a touch of sleaziness .  martins bilko is a pale imitation .  the only semi-bright spot is phil hartman as bilkos arch-enemy .  its not saying much  considering martins lackluster character  but hartman leaves him in the dust .  , NEGhave you ever been in an automobile accident where youve miraculously walked away with only a few scratches  yet the car has been obliterated into an unrecognizable  mangled wreck ?  well  that has never actually happened to me and i hope that none of us will ever experience this situation .  but after watching this inane exercise of a movie  i certainly feel that ive miraculously walked away unscathed after a two-hour ride that mercilessly careens back and forth before finally plummeting into an icy pond .  oddly  `eye of the beholder   which is a psychological-romance-thriller  starts off promisingly enough when the opening sequence introduces us to a british intelligence agent  called the eye ( ewan mcgregor )  working in washington dc .  in the humorous opening scene  he eyes a top lawyer across the street in his office with his pants down .  using an array of high-tech surveillance and communications equipment  he proceeds to transmit pictures of the bared lawyer to pc screens and fax machines in his office .  the law firms employees get a good chuckle .  the audience gets a good chuckle .  the eye is later given an assignment where he encounters a beautiful woman ( ashley judd ) .  there is something compelling about this mysterious woman .  despite her glamorous looks  however  we learn that she is a psychopath with a propensity to kill men that get too close to her .  after the murders  she sobs while singing the christmas tune `little bluebirds and laments about being abandoned by her father long ago .  after each killing  she puts on a different wig  assumes a new name  and then makes her way to another state .  the eye has witnessed all her murderous transgressions .  but he does not alert the authorities .  he somehow empathizes with her sense of loss .  the eye  it turns out  also is haunted by his past .  his daughter was taken away from him and he anguishes this loss every day of his life .  his tormented psyche creates a ghost-like image of his daughter with which he engages in conversation .  she becomes a sort of spectral adviser  and one thing that the ghostly daughter says is that he must help the woman .  he now diverts his energies into trying to help her find some kind of salvation .  it doesnt matter that he has witnessed all of her murders .  and it doesnt matter that the eye is abnormally reticent  hiding his entire life behind computer screens .  he follows her to a dozen different locales and shadows her every move to keep her out of trouble .  when a crazed druggie ( jason priestley ) attacks her  he shows up for some quick butt kicking .  when the police are closing in to arrest her  he provides a distraction so that she can escape .  all the while  the woman has no idea who her guardian angel is and the eye stays just out of sight .  peculiar .  how bad is this movie ?  i refer you to my `review quote source litmus test .  just take a look at the full-page ad in the newspaper and see where they are pulling quotes .  for this movie  they are from magazines called `flaunt and `mirabella .   no doubt  they were impressed with judds series of catwalks and disguise changes .  the major problem with `eye of the beholder is that the film jerks forward  always unsure of its ultimate destination .  if it was a thriller  there was little to keep us entranced .  if it was a love story  there was absolutely no emotional pull .  completely disjointed in structure  its only saving grace was its stylish look which reminded me of my favorite car commercial ( the one where the `6 on the tachometer dissolves into a winding road and a passenger rail car dissolves into a small miniature on a childs train set ) .  i am also still hopeful that ashley judd will find a serious role to showcase her potential talents .  beyond that  the film is hopelessly out-of-control and is in need of seriously better traction and handling .  , NEGbad . bad .  bad .  that one word seems to pretty much sums up beyond the valley of the dolls .  if that summary isnt enough for you  how about t&a  t&a  t&a ?  still havent got the point ?  other than director russ meyers predilection for casting attractive large breasted women who ultimately expose the afore-mentioned anatomical areas  there is really only one other reason to recommend even taking a look at this movie .  that is the fact that it was co-written by famed film critic roger ebert  who also was responsible for the screenplay .  after watching this movie you will never be able to sit through another one of his reviews where he gives a movie a thumbs down for bad writing with a straight face .  this movie stinks out loud .  quite frankly  this movie deserves a .  but there are parts of it that are so bad they are almost funny .  so im giving it a .  and maybe that is too generous .  right from the opening credits  i knew that i had a class-a bomb on my hands .  not only are the way the credits actually shot distracting  but the first scene you see includes a big breasted young woman being chased by a guy in a nazi uniform .  i had absolutely no idea why the hell that was happening ( it does get explained later ) and as soon as the first scene is over  we cut to a completely unrelated scene .  to be honest  as i sat through this movie mesmerized by just how incredibly awful it was  i actually forgot about the seemingly out of place opening until it popped up again later in the film .  with the quality of the writing during the rest of the film  it wouldnt have surprised me if the opening had never been explained .  so what is this movie about ?  you ask .  like it really matters .  ok  here goes .  this all-girl band headed by kelly macnamara ( dolly reed ) and her friends go to hollywood to try to gain a foothold in the music industry .  once there  they do manage to find success ( due as much to their hooters as anything else ? it sure wasnt for their brutally bad singing voices )  and the movie chronicles how their lives change for the worse as the pressures of fame get to them .  everything from big egos  to booze and drugs to free flowing sex sends them on a downward spiral .  there are a couple of other idiotic subplots thrown in for good measure  but the fame is the one that pretty much sums up this thing .  >from a creative standpoint there is nothing redeeming here .  other than the above-mentioned obsession with big knockers that russ meyer seemed to have .  the dialogue is so incredibly bad that it literally is funny in parts .  mr . ebert has generously thrown in helpings of  hey man    dig  and my all time favorite --  this is my happening  and it freaks me out  .  now i ask you  with lines like that how can you go wrong ?  ebert had tried to inject as many big words as possible into the dialogue .  maybe he thought it would make the movie seem smarter .  i dont know  but all the big words in the world wouldnt be able to disguise the bad writing and even worse acting .  but the wretched dialogue goes along well with the wretched quality of everything else in this movie .  ive seen home movies directed better than meyer managed with this turkey .  in fact  there is one scene -- the one in which they are in a van driving to hollywood to make their fortunes -- during which i really had to question if meyer or his editors had just suffered serious head injuries .  add to the directing and writing the music in this movie .  i almost got up to check my sound system to see if it was broken  there was such a pile of crap emanating from the speakers .  then we have the cast .  first lets start david gurian who played harris  the manager of the band .  this has got to be the goofiest looking guy that has ever set foot in front of a motion picture camera .  sadly  his acting doesnt come close to making up for his looks .  if you have been following along up to this point  this shouldnt surprise you .  meyers stable of well endowed girls also have the benefit of being fairly attractive to go along with their other assets .  dolly reed plays kelly  the leader of the band .  and no surprise here  she was cast for her cup size  not her talents .  and yes  she does loose the shirt a few times and display her impressive talents .  sadly  her ass is almost as large as her chest .  hey  it a sexist movie  so im writing a sexist review .  then we have former playboy playmate cynthia myers in a fairly small role as casey  one of the other band members .  this goes along with the rest of the idiotic thinking in the movie .  meyer casts a gorgeous playmate with a rack to kill for and who obviously has no acting talent at all  but her nude scenes are the biggest disappointment of all .  sure russ  now is the time to get artsy and throw in some well placed shadows .  on the up side  she does have a fun lesbo scene .  i sound like im writing a review in a porn magazine .  but hey  ill admit it ; the only reason that i actually managed to sit through this damn movie was to catch a look at cynthia myers naked .  and since that was a huge disappointment  i pretty much wasted two hours of my life on this turkey .  the only thing that i can say about this movie is that you should stay away from it .  unless of course you want to feel good about yourself by knowing that even a pulitzer prize winning film critic like roger ebert has screwed up at least once in his life too .  and if you are thinking of checking it out for the double ds -- you are better off just downloading nude cynthia myers pictures off the internet .  this is a movie that should be avoided at all costs .  an even better idea might be to require video stores to place a warning on the box of beyond the valley of the dolls -- beware : this movie is extremely hazardous to your common sense .  proceed with extreme caution .  , NEGby-the-numbers : a film which introduces characters  situations  dilemmas and developments that weve seen before in a parade of other films .  a film which can easily be guessed out by the end of frame number one .  a film which is packed to the cap with predictability  leading to very little tension  excitement  suspense or interest on the part of its paying audience .  in short  a clich ? -ridden formula film .  welcome to my review of the generals daughter .  plot : an undercover army detective and a rape counselor find themselves locked inside an investigation into some bigwig general daughters rape  torture and murder .  they must delve through all of the unspoken army rules and the hush-hushes  to figure out the conspiracy behind the shocking murder .  critique : by the numbers ( see above ) .  this film is just there .  it sits there on the big screen for a couple of hours  floats around  goes away  hopefully never to be heard from again .  it is so predictable that even a blind man could see its plot points coming a mile away .  its as suspenseful as a leaf dropping from a tree .  its as action-packed as a canadian curling tournament .  get the picture ?  i sure did . . . its  too bad that it took my friend and i less than two minutes to figure out the entire plot  and to break down each scene before it was even completed .  easy as pie .  its unfortunate because james woods and john travolta actually have one extremely enjoyable scene together near the beginning of the film  but alas  twas not to be ( that scene alone scored two of my four points allotted . )  woods chews it up in the few scenes that hes in  travolta passes the test  cromwell plays  well  cromwell  and stowe is window dressing with a smile ( mia since 12 monkeys ( 8/10 ) it seems ) .  and this predictability isnt reserved only to those who have seen films like courage under fire or a few good men  it runs deep inside every one of us who knows to suspect someone as soon as they see their obvious guilty mug on the big screen .  its like riding a bike .  other scenarios which sponge out any tension  suspense or interest from this film include every single character eventually  breaking down  to the investigators without much reason given  a ridiculously placed background relationship between two of the lead characters  as much action as my grandparents bedroom nightly  and a directorial style that can only reward director simon west with a solid nomination for the  best poor mans michael bay doing his best poor mans impression of tony scott  ( add two scenes with sunlight shining through some half-open shades for grit and integrity  and an all-out rainfall for the finale for further chaos  and youre a great director .  yawn .  yeah  whatever tony . . . i  mean  simon . )  and arent we all sick of hearing about these army  bad boys  and their overdone  code of silence  ? !  enough already !  next subject  please .  see it on video if you wanna fall asleep after seeing a much better movie like an officer and a gentleman ( 8 . 5/10 ) .  otherwise  save yourself the trouble and go take a crap instead .  youll feel much better afterwards .  trust me .  little known facts about this film and its stars : ironically  john travolta turned down the lead role in an officer and a gentleman  which eventually went to little dickie gere .  ironically on james woods part  he completed one of his earliest acting roles on tvs  welcome back  kotter   starring none other than john travolta .  actor james woods recently confirmed reports of his  big dick  on howard sterns radio program .  unlike rocker tommy lee  woods is also alleged to have an iq of 180 .  he apparently scored a perfect 800 on his verbal sats and a 779 on the math section .  what a man !  john travolta is married to actress kelly preston  and they have a son named jett ( travolta loves them planes ! ) .  word on the street is that the kid was apparently conceived during a weekend at demi moore and bruce willis home .  director simon wests first film was the jerry bruckheimer produced con air ( 6 . 5/10 ) .  before that  he directed tv commercials including the budweiser ad with the dancing ants .  yippee !  veteran director john frankenheimer ( ronin ( 7 . 5/10 )   the manchurian candidate ) portrays the character of general sonnenberg in this film .  the imdb reports that when senator robert kennedy was shot at the ambassador hotel in los angeles on june 5  1968  it was his good friend john frankenheimer who had personally driven him there that day .  clarence williams iii  who plays colonel fowler in this film  is known to some from his role as  linc  in the original  mod squad  tv series .  younger folk may remember him as princes father in purple rain .  , NEGwho knew that in 16 years eddie murphy  who made such a brash  raucous big-screen splash in _48_hrs . _   would become . . .  cuddly .  the disconcerting trend begun in this summers cutesy  largely laugh-free _doctor_dolittle_ continues with this earnest-to-a-fault dramedy .  although he is top-billed  here murphy is merely support for jeff goldblum  who plays ricky hayman  the programming director at a home shopping network .  sales are way down  and rickys job hangs by a thread until he meets g ( murphy )  a mysterious spiritual guru whom a desperate ricky puts on the air .  while sales skyrocket and g becomes an overnight sensation  the reinvigorated rickys greed grows  endangering his budding romance with a goodhearted media research consultant ( kelly preston ) .  writer tom schulman has some promising ideas  satirizing home shopping and infomercials and the nature of instant celebrity .  but these ideas would have more bite if stephen herek had invested any energy into the direction of the film .  the sluggishly paced _holy_man_ is not only slow and overlong ( 113 minutes )  but an unfunny bore  and murphy can do little to juice up the proceedings ; cleansed of both the attitude _and_ comic sensibility that made him a star ( g is  for the most part  a straight man )  he is a curiously lifeless presence .  goldblum is actually quite good  but its hard for the audience to sustain much interest in his character and spiritual journey when the director doesnt seem to be much interested  either .  , NEG  pokemon 3 : the movie  has a lot of bad things in it .  first of all its a plot heavy mess that has bad voice talents  badly written script and fantastic animation .  the first film came out the end of 1999 and was a huge hit grossing almost $90 million domestically .  a sequel soon followed and even made $45 million .  warner has released their third movie based on the immensely popular video game and tv series and its a waste of time and celluloid .  this time ash ketchum and his friends are on their way to the johto battles ( which my little brother told me the new spinoff is  pokemon : the johto journeys  so go figure ) anyway he comes in contact with a young girl whos father has disappeared after trying to discover the unown .  they are small pokemon with a powerful punch and have great psychic abilities .  the unown bring together their psychic abilities and create entei a powerful legendary pokemon who barriers young mollys house and creates every wish she wants .  now its up to ash and his friends to stop this pokemon entei and show him to be a good pokemon rather than a bad one .  too bad really that this is a bad movie  surprisingly the first movie was entertaining and somewhat absorbing  the second was a piece of trash and this one is almost in between .  it has some good qualities ( animation  message in the end ) but the flaws seem to overpower the goods .  im still not sure what the big thing is about pokemon  they are ugly little animals who speak their own name for their language ( besides meowth  my personal favorite ) and you dont understand what they are saying .  my little brother just thought the movie was amazing  and i kept leaning over and asking him happened  or what pokemon that was .  his response was a big lecture of how this is that  and that is this . . . he  sure did put me in my place .  with the second and third movie being bad  i have a feeling pokemon 4 : the movie might be a total bust as well .    pokemon 3 : the movie  has some redeeming qualities for the kids  and the pokemon fans will dig every minute of this film .  for those parents and/or brothers and sisters who have to sit through this . . . bring a pillow .  , NEG1 . he doesnt have a hard-to-decipher accent  2 . he doesnt always speak in a monotone  and 3 .  his face doesnt always wear the same impassive expression .  in short  the former nfl player turned fox sportscaster turned actor is too good to be bad  but too bad to be good .  unfortunately  the same cannot be said of his first star vehicle  firestorm  which is just plain awful .  one of the most glaring problems with long ( who made his acting debut in john woos broken arrow ) is that hes so mediocre that he often blends in with the scenery .  as ace firefighter jesse graves  long is supposed to be playing a bigger-than-life action hero -- the kind of he- man who will crash through a flaming door to save a child or parachute into a burning clearing to rescue some stupid campers .  unfortunately  despite the best efforts of first-time director dean semler to photograph long using heroic shots that make kevin costners work in the postman look stark  jesse turns out to be a pretty boring good guy .  to put it kindly  this is not a well-written motion picture .  firestorm is a collection of howlingly bad lines set against a backdrop of disaster movie clich ? s which  taken together  form something that requires a level of viewer inebriation to be recognized as a plot .  the only reason this film is getting one star ( instead of something lower ) is that most of the fire sequences are realistic  and i was fascinated by the meticulous planning that must have been necessary to stage them effectively .  were introduced to our big burly hero one afternoon when he and some colleagues jump into the midst of a forest fire to save a group of people .  during this sequence  our big burly hero proves that hes also a sensitive guy by risking his life to save a little girl and her dog ( yes  the dog lives ) from being broiled alive .  flash-forward a year .  now  our big burly hero is taking over as chief of his smokejumpers association  replacing outgoing honcho wynt perkins ( real actor scott glenn ) .  but this day  our big burly heros first in charge  isnt going to be business-as-usual .  a group of nasty escaped criminals have set a wyoming forest alight to aid their flight to freedom .  led by randy earl shaye ( william forsythe )  the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die  they pose as canadian firefighters who somehow got lost across the border .  along the way  they meet and take hostage the damsel in distress ( suzy amis ) .  eventually  our big burly hero is placed in a position where he has to fight the fire  rescue the damsel in distress  defeat the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die  and restore order to the galaxy .  firestorms director  dean semler  is a former cinematographer ( he won an academy award for his work on dances with wolves )  so its no surprise that the film looks good .  unfortunately  thats firestorms lone asset  and it falters near the end  when computer-generated special effects fill up the screen .  these are of about equal quality to what you might observe on a nintendo 64 video game .  the action sequences  which include a variety of chases  are occasionally interesting  but never invigorating .  everyone  including long  appears to be going through the motions .  there isnt a memorable performance to be found from beginning to end  unless you count the forest fire  which generates some heat .  as the sadistic creep who must be killed twice to really die  william forsythe lacks panache .  hes worse than a generic bad guy ; hes a boring generic bad guy who doesnt have any snappy one-liners to hurl at our big burly hero .  my advice to scott glenn ( absolute power ) and suzy amis ( titanic ) is to accidentally forget this film the next time theyre making out a resume .  theres some small comfort in knowing this early in the year that i already have one entry for my bottom 10 list .   ( at least i hope there arent 10 worse films than this . )  and i know i wasnt the only one who really disliked this movie .  as the audience was filing out of the screening  i loitered in the theater lobby to catch a few comments .  the general consensus seemed to be that  although the movie sucked  the promotional key ring was cool .  the problem is that fox wont be giving out key rings to regular movie-goers  so that nixes any reason to see firestorm .  , NEGseen at : amc old pasadena 8  pasadena  ca ( in sdds )  paul verhoevens last movie  showgirls  had a bad script  bad acting  and a  plot  ( i use the word in its loosest possible sense ) that served only to allow lots of sex and nudity .  it stank .  starship troopers has a bad script  bad acting  and a  plot  that serves only to allow lots of violence and gore .  it stinks .  nobody will watch this movie for the plot  but heres a brief synopsis anyway .  some friends straight out of high school sign up for the federal reserve ( armed forces ) at a time when evil bugs from the planet klendathu are sending meteors towards earth from the other side of the galaxy .  after one slips through the defences and destroys buenos aires ( the home city of the main characters )  war is declared .  this involves sending the grunts  who include johnny rico ( van dien ) and dizzy ( meyer )  down to the surface of the bugs planet .  much carnage ensues .  the troops are withdrawn and sent to another planet to answer a distress call .  more carnage ensues .  after being rescued  their plans are changed to capture a  brain bug  which is believed to be controlling the aliens battle plans ( look  i didnt write this  ok ? ) .  yet more carnage ensues .  get the picture ?  interspersed throughout all this are brief  ads  from the federal network  which present the picture of a neo-fascist state  much like in verhoevens robocop .  there are many problems with starship troopers .  the plot  where one exists to drive the movie onwards  is silly .  harris ( star of tvs doogie howser  md ) is presented with a psychic ability to talk to his ferret early on in the movie  apparently so we will accept his ability to mind-meld with a  brain bug  later on .  in addition  the first thirty minutes of the movie ( until the characters sign up for service ) drag on like a bad episode of beverly hills  90210 .  the characters are one-dimensional  so much so  that when dizzy is killed  she says its ok because she got to sleep with rico .  i had hoped that verhoevens use of a no-name cast would allow him to kill off several of the lead characters to surprise the audience  but such an idea appears to have escaped him .  the dialogue is embarassing and isnt helped by the frequently terrible delivery ( i almost burst out laughing when harris delivered his speech about the need to sacrifice a few hundred people for the good of the species ) .  finally  the fake  ads  become a nuisance .  although they evoke the propaganda of the wwii-era movietone reels ( as presumably they are meant to )  their complete lack of subtlety blunts their effect .  some people will say all of thats irrelevant -- the movie hinges on the battle scenes .  so what about those battle scenes ?  well  i admit the effects are good -- the bugs move about quite convincingly  especially when they have been deprived of a few of their limbs .  and people have their brains blown out  their limbs cut off  and their bodies ripped in two in quite impressive ways .  but this is my problem .  the entertainment value of the film rests almost entirely on its graphic portrayal of gore  and its continous attempt to gross us out ( starting early on when richards character vomits on-screen ) .  verhoeven appears to be trying to make a movie employing the elements that made a robocop a success  but fails spectacularly .  while robocop had a message about the importance of being human  and gave the bad guys some motivation  starship troopers lacks even these simple features .  when the brain bug sucks out a characters brain near the end of the film  its merely an analogy for what the film has done to us .  this film is full of graphic violence and is not suitable for children under 16 .  , NEGoften similar to a little boy lost in a park that he had no right venturing into  the call of the oboe ( o toque do oboe ) is a disappointing film that seems to have wandered astray .  many elements of the film are solid  and have potential far greater than director claudio macdowell will ever know  but they simply dont convert into a solid work .  although a setting is never established  it becomes apparent .  the film takes place somewhere in a latin american village in present day .  the community is a dull one  where every day is a downhill slide from the last .  over time  the people have taken to themselves .  the town cinema is closed  no tourist has passed through in years  and the daily funeral processions are accompanied by no one other than the grave digger .  so what happens when a  tourist  ( paolo betti ) does arrive one day ?  he sends this routine and dull town into mayhem and shock .  it is revealed that he is a musician who plays the oboe as a hobby .  when he sits down in the park one day to give a solo performance  the entire community gathers around for their first bit of entertainment in countless years .  it is from that that the musician meets some of the villagers  and agrees to play at the local cinema in accompaniment to a silent film  thus opening the theatre for the first time in ages .  the woman that talks him into this witty task is the cinema owner ( leticia vota ) who also happens to be engaged to the towns police inspector  a figure who soon becomes suspicious of his fiances involvement with this musician .  the rest of the plot closely resembles a freak show gone horribly astray .  it features a character who literally rises from his grave  a woman who has a phone conversation with god  and the aforementioned inspector who goes from an intriguing and serious character  to an almost humorous drunk .  technically  this film is a nightmare .  the music score is poorly edited into the film  so it is often choppy  rough  and abrupt .  the lighting is poor at best  which makes it increasingly difficult to focus on many scenes  and the english subtitles are full of misspelled words  and are often absent presumably on the assumption that the audience will be able to understand some simple portuguese and spanish phrases .  this translation flaw is best highlighted at the beginning of the film when what seems to be a relevant fight is filled with dialogue  but the subtitles are limited to fewer than 25 words .  in addition  the pace of the film seems uneven .  it opens with a series of long panoramic shots that alone can test ones patience .  the film then moves into a faster pace  that again slows towards the end  as the director seems determined to reach the two hour mark .  there was  however  potential for this film .  it is a piece exploring the beauty of cinema and music  and the re-unification of people .  these are all topics that could easily fill a movie .  perhaps  if there were no freak show  and the technical aspects were to improve  there might just be a thing of beauty at the end .  most importantly  though  the director would have to patch up the plot and make it flow better so that the two hours arent such a bore .  until then  there seems to be little more hope for this piece  than that boy has by simply crying out  mommy  while he wanders astray in a park .  , NEGa friend invites you to a movie .  this film would evade the explosions and special effects of standard summer fare  and be grounded in reality .  the plot is as follows : after a terrifying incident  a mother and her independent daughter separate from the father and move away from the city .  they need fresh air to get some perspective  maybe to start over .  romance begins to brew  however  as one of the locals  played by an international superstar in rugged clothing  sparks things up  ( especially at a country-western slow dance ) .  it stars a rising young starlet  helms a good cast  and is directed by one of the better actor-turned-directors in hollywood .  you accept .  you jump at the opportunity to see  what you believe to be  _the horse whisperer_ .  but  poor moviegoer  you have been conned .  alas  you find yourself watching  incredulously  _hope floats_ .  oh  woe .  your hope has sunk .  why was this movie made ?  why was it released ?  it is a travesty on nearly every level  and has the authority to sink the careers of nearly everyone involved .  at the hands of a better script  the film could have been a gem .  but it is clueless as to what it is about  and only succeeds in transferring same cluelessness to us poor viewers .  _hope floats_ stars sandra bullock as birdy  who  after discovering her husband has been cheating on her with her best friend ( on national television no less )  takes her daughter and drives back to her home  helmed by a countryish bumpkin eccentric played by gena rowlands  ( she decorates with stuffed wildlife ) .  birdys nephew  travis ( played by _leave it to beaver_s cameron finley )  is under her custody  and in one of the films many failed in-jokes  is always seen wearing a different halloween costume .  what is the point of this ?  does it make any sense ?  is it supposed to be funny ?  the point of the film is to show that the family is eccentric  but i was convinced that the grandma should have been locked up for endangering the mental welfare of a child .  all of this undercuts the plot  of which there is none .  there are only many scenes that are supposed to register emotion .  theres the scene where birdy  who used to be the prom queen  is humbled by approaching a peer she once mocked  for a job .  theres the scene where birdy dances with her father  in the hospital for alzheimers .  and then theres the sentimental scenes with justin  played by harry connick jr .  who is taking a liking to her again  showing her a beautiful pad that he built from scratch .  and during each of these scenes  i was sidetracked by my earlier question .  what sort of eccentric grandmother go through such great pains as to provide a dog costume  a kermit costume  a cowboy costume ( with whip )  and a full furred barney costume for her grandson to wear during dinner ?  what sort of warped ramifications would this lead for the rest of his life ?  outside of this  there are other sure signs of screenwriters block .  when the daughter stands up to the bully at school .  when birdy almost loses her job .  when the family pulls in a goofy lip-synch to cheer someone up .  when someone dies .  when the daughter cries  ( no  wails ) in exasperation that her father is not coming back .  in a movie like this  you notice the strings being pushed  and you sit there  comatose  hoping it will end .  who can survive such a debacle ?  i worry for bullocks career  which has been running on auto-pilot for the last few years .  she has an attitude  a solid perkiness  and can drive a bus--but she cant handle the emotional scenes  much less hold a southern accent .  harry connick  jr . is worse--stick with singing  or get some acting lessons  please !  gena rowlands is the best part of the film .  but shes such a good actress  that it staggers the mind that shes weighed down by such lukewarm material here .  it would be a severe tragedy if the recurring star of john cassavettes great films is known for this film .  two notes to forest whittaker : ( 1 ) cut the slow-motion sequences .  there are twelve times where you undercut your own direction by such a failed trick .  have you done so  you could have shaved off ten-minutes of this almost unbearable debacle .   ( 2 ) youve had to know something was wrong if your cinematographers filter makes the candlelight appear like little  x  s .  youre not a bad director  but you cant change a terrible script .  theres a recurring scene where birdy  working at the neighborhood fotomat  finds the machine go wrong  and image after destroyed  warped  dark image appear .  think about it .  a succession of destroyed images may have been more entertaining than this movie .  , NEGany remake of an alfred hitchcock film is at best an uncertain project  as a perfect murder illustrates .  frankly  dial m for murder is not one of the master directors greatest efforts  so there is ample room for improvement .  unfortunately  instead of updating the script  ironing out some of the faults  and speeding up the pace a little  a perfect murder has inexplicably managed to eliminate almost everything that was worthwhile about dial m for murder  leaving behind the nearly- unwatchable wreckage of a would-be 90s thriller .  almost all suspense films are loaded with plot implausibilities .  the best thrillers keep viewers involved enough in whats going on so that these flaws in logic dont become apparent until long after the final credits have rolled .  unfortunately  in a perfect murder  the faults are often so overt that we become aware of them as theyre happening .  this is a very bad sign .  not only do such occurrences shatter any suspension of disbelief  but they have the astute viewer looking for the next such blunder .  of course  in the case of a perfect murder  at least that gives an audience member something to do besides concentrating on the inane plot and the lifeless  cardboard characters .  a perfect murder isnt a strict remake of dial m for murder  but it does borrow heavily from frederick knotts play ( which was also the source material for hitchcocks version  as well as a 1981 made-for-tv retelling ) .  emily hayes ( gwyneth paltrow ) is the wealthy wife of powerful wall street mover-and-shaker steven hayes ( michael douglas ) .  their marriage isnt going well -- emily resents stevens controlling instincts  and  as a form of rebellion  she is having an affair with a penniless painter  david shaw ( viggo mortensen ) .  when steven learns of the relationship  he decides to confront david  but his approach isnt that of a typical cuckolded husband .  instead of yelling or threatening  steven offers david a proposal thats too good to resist : for $500  000 in cash ( $100  000 before  the rest after )  he is to break into stevens new york apartment and kill emily .   ( of course  after getting the first payment  david never bothers to ask how hes supposed to get the rest . )  ultimately  im not sure which of the three main characters were supposed to be sympathetic to : the cold-hearted husband  who wants his wife dead so he can get his hands on her fortune ; her mercenary lover  who is willing to do the deed for half-a-million ; or the woman  who is happily carrying on an extramarital affair .  not only are these individuals all profoundly dislikable  but theyre not interesting .   ( its possible to make a good movie with detestable characters -- see reservoir dogs -- but there has to be something compelling about them  which  in this case  there isnt . )  steven  emily  and david are all lifted directly from the screenwriting 101 text book on stereotypes .  the actors in this film are obviously just on hand to get their paychecks .  michael douglas is playing the kind of heartless tycoon that he can do in his sleep -- hes gordon gekko with an unfaithful wife .  gwyneth paltrow  who was recently delightful and appealing in sliding doors  is simply awful here .  she now has the dubious distinction of have starred in two of 1998s worst thrillers ( the other being hush ) .  at least viggo mortensen ( g . i .  jane ) has a little fun with his part  but then he usually does interesting things even in bad movies .  the thin supporting cast includes david suchet  the star of  poirot   as a police inspector  and sarita choudhury ( kama sutra ) as emilys best friend .  a perfect murder is a plodding production that generates almost no suspense from beginning to end .  there arent many twists and turns in the unexpectedly linear script  which makes the ending inevitable almost from the start .  its surprising to see director andrew davis  the man behind the fugitive  involved in this mess  but  like his stars  he too needs to earn a living .  its just that remaking hitchcock  and doing it so badly  hardly seems to be an honorable way to go about getting the dough .  , NEGsteve martin shines but sgt . bilko  fails to impress  based on the popular 50s sitcom  sgt .  bilko follows the string of old-sitcoms-to-movie conversion fever .  remember the brady bunch movie or the beverly hillbillies released sometime back ?   ( brady bunch was a moderate hit in in the us while hillbillies flopped ) .  i do not really know whether the hollywood minds are running out of good ideas or just being plain lazy  but the tv-conversion-movies are hitting our screens like wildfire  sad to say  with mixed success .  such movies are mostly targeted at us viewers since they are usually followings of such series over there and the larger the following  the more likely the sitcom will be made into a movie .  sgt .  bilko ( frankly  i have not seen any its original tv version )  even with the charm and wild antics of funnymen steve martin and dan akroyd ; failed to entertain .  sgt . ernest bilko is the man behind the motor pool ( place of vehicle storage and repair ) of fort baxter .  though totally unskilled in the field of work that he is supposed to be in charge of  he has an almost superhuman ability and zeal to sniff out money-making opportunities ; from running a gambling den in the military garage to 4-d pools .  though materialistic in mind  bilkos methods has thoughtfully `enriched the lives of the men of fort baxter  providing them with some form of real recreation within the camp and the people love him for that .  colonel hall runs the entire fort and thanks to his inborn `blissfully-confused state  bilko has managed to hide his operation  though nearly every living person in the fort knows about it .  bilkos state of ascent is suddenly under-fire when the pentagon sends major thorn  a tough cookie on army regulations  to check on the progress on the $70 million hovertank project  a new weapon under development within the forts grounds .  to add to his problems  thorn is determined to bring bilko down in retalliation of a major `sabo done on him by bilko during their younger army days .  director jonathan lynn  who directed my cousin vinny ( in which marisa tomei won an oscar for best-supporting actress ) managed to pull sgt .  bilko through with suitable pacing and some exceptional moments of laughter  but that is about it .  there are really not enough laughter-packed-moments in sgt .  bilko to fully entertain the average movie-goer .  still  steve martins sgt .  bilko is played with finesse and full-force by the renowned comedian .  without him  sgt .  bilko would have just fell flat on its face .  sgt .  bilko did moderately well in the us box office early this year but i doubt it will earn much elsewhere around the world .  the current trend in mixed successes in such tv-conversions may be a blessing in disguise  really ; at least it will force hollywood to re-think any of its initial intentions to turn another tv-idea into a movie or at the very least approach those ideas with more creativity .  unless you are a fan of the tv-series or love to watch steve martin in action  you can skip this one when deciding which movie to catch in the local theatres .  im sure there are better ones around .  , NEGlook ! the new version of  psycho  came out and the world didnt end !  i guess gus van sant really isnt the bringer of the apocalypse !  unfortunately  though  that  psycho  didnt end the world as we know is the best thing that can be said for it .  van sants controversial  re-telling  of alfred hitchcocks classic 1960 film has polarized filmgoers everywhere ( even before it premiered . )  without benefit of an actual viewing  many have said that the film will  at best  suck .  being an ( almost ) good critic  i waited until i actually saw it to decide that the film  at best  sucked ( and that concludes the use of the word  suck  and  hopefully  the thoughts that i am a brain-dead orangutan . )  director gus van sant took the original hitchcock film and refilmed it  shot-for-shot  using the same  exact script ( with a few minor alterations . )  the inherent challenge was in making the film suspenseful and scary  even though a large group of the audience will know exactly what will happen at the exact time .  suspense probably could have been attained if the actors had been able to create something new or different than the original .  sadly  that did not occur .  it is hard to be overshadowed by vera miles and john gavin ( from the original  psycho )  but that is what exactly happened to julianne moore and viggo mortensen .  in moores case  the film would have been helped if  the x- files  gillian anderson had been cast instead ; especially since moore goes through the entire film doing a scully impression !  from the cold demeanor and expressions to her rigid way of forming a sentence  moore is scully !  mortensen ( who i liked in  g . i .  jane  ) opts to play sam loomis as a cowboy/hick  which would have been nice if he had gone past that starting point .  sam has a twang and a cowboy hat  but thats about it .  mortensen turns in one of the most uptight performance in recent memory .  anne heche  in the janet leigh role  does a few good things in her brief time on screen .  at least her marion crane has a little life in her  which cant be said for most of the rest of the cast .  the best work  though  comes from vince vaughn  as the demented mamas boy  norman bates .  hes not going to make anyone forget anthony perkins  but he is effective both in being naughty and nice .  the best part of the film is the dinner scene heche and vaughn  where they simply talk .  there is some solid acting there  something that is not carried through the rest of the film .  van sant has made a boring film .  all the camera tricks that hitchcock so eloquently used in 1960 arent as eye-catching now .  what passed for brilliance then has been copied so many times by so many directors that they dont impress or excite .  van sant  in what i assume is a grasp at originality  decided to put some stream-of-consciousness images into a few famous scenes ( was that a lamb in the middle of the road ? )  these images  included with some questionable editing choices  took away from the scenes themselves and caused  at first  bewilderment and  later  laughter .  definitely not hitchcocks intention !  at least danny elfman had the good sense to not mess with bernard herrmanns original famous and terrific score .  if a film like  psycho  does not frighten  then whats the point .  aside from norman  the characters are thinly drawn people who leave no connection with the audience .  there are things van sant and company could have done to at least make their recreation interesting .  in the end  however  the new  psycho  is a noble attempt  but  alas  a dismal failure .  , NEGan american werewolf in london is john landis groundbreaking feature about an american tourist who gets himself bitten by a werewolf in jolly old england .  the groundbreaking part of the movie is the special effects .  more specifically  the makeup used for the transformation of a man into a werewolf ; and for the ghosts that haunt the main character .  even twenty years after its release  that part of the movie is still impressive .  although  i would have to say that it really is the only part of the movie that could be considered impressive .  the rest of the movie is a run of the mill werewolf flick with some extra gore thrown in for good measure .  if it werent for the cutting edge makeup effects used in the werewolf transformation it is most likely that this is a film that would have gone largely unnoticed when it was released back in 1980 .  and with good reason -- the acting isnt great and neither is the writing .  well ok  we dont actually expect either of those things to be great in a horror film .  but one other important element is lacking here too -- it isnt scary .  with no exception  you know what is going to happen before it happens .  you dont even need the obligatory scary music to give you a hint .  i will give director john landis credit for this being one of the best looking horror films that i have ever seen .  but john  it just wasnt scary .  i didnt know if this was intended to be some sort of romantic drama and the whole werewolf thing was just thrown in to get people to come to the theater to see it  but it didnt work for me .  actually  it was intended as a sort of a spoof on horror films .  but the mix of the comedic moments with the melodrama was so bad ; the intended humor was lost on me .  its never a good sign that you dont realize a movie is supposed to be funny until after the movie is long over and you read it in the background material .  call me crazy  but you shouldnt have to do research on a movie to enjoy it .  im not even going to get into the plot of the movie that much  since the title pretty well sums the whole thing up .  werewolf bites boy ( david naughton ) .  boy ends up in hospital where he is tended to and eventually falls for pretty nurse ( jenny agutter ) and then strange things begin to happen to boy .  including  and i must admit this is a very nice touch  visits from his friend who was killed in the same werewolf attack that ended up with him in the hospital .  the neat thing here is that his buddy is a rapidly deteriorating corpse .  i know it sounds strange  but it actually works .  the scenes between david naughton and the dead buddy ( griffin dunne ) are really the best parts of the movie .  as i said  probably the only reason that this film was a hit was because of the special effects .  while they are still impressive today  they arent impressive enough  or plentiful enough to warrant watching this film .  and since they are more or less the highlight of the film  there are far better choices out there if you want a scary movie to curl up with your sweetheart to watch .  actually  the 1998 sequel  an american werewolf in paris  is more entertaining since it doesnt take itself as seriously and actually provides a few more laughs along the way .  , NEGcapsule : annoyingly unentertaining  obvious and paper-thin buddy/cop/drug/sexy-witness movie .  presence of director michael bay shows none of the talent he demonstrated in the rock .  ive seen this movie already  i said  as i looked at the box art .  no  i havent even seen a trailer for the movie ; i dont even know what its about  but i can look at the way theyre promoting it  and i know ive seen it already .  i thought : its about these two cops .  and theyre buddies  sort of .  theyre at each others throats a lot  but they really do like each other .  and everyone else in their department hates them cause theyre hot-shots .  and they have some kind of diametric opposition in their relationship .  and one day theyre in the middle of cop business as usual when they get mixed up in this plot that involves a really sadistic bad guy with lots of henchmen who can never hit anything with the billions of rounds of ammo they are always carrying .  and the bad guy is a drug lord .  and theres a witness  and shes this sexy thing who rubs both of them the wrong way .  and their supervisor wants their badges for breakfast when they blow up half the town bringing this guy down .  i only missed the bit about the badges .  the rest i got dead-on .  and i hadnt even left the video store yet .  the cops in this movie are will smith and martin lawrence  and the bad guy is the immensely underutilized tcheky karyo .  smith plays a cop who has a trust fund and is thus not a cop for the money ; martin l . is a family man ( shades of the now-tired lethal weapon dynamic here ) whose wife and he are at total odds .  this leads to some strained scenes about lawrences  not getting any   and some totally unneccesary bits with him skulking around his own house  thinking his partner is now his wifes  back door man  .  not funny ; tiresome .  bad boys gets some of its incredibly meager selling points from the presence of will smith and martin lawrence .  will smith is a natural  and im happy to see him in movies like six degrees . . .  and men in black .  hes funny and charming without trying to be ; he really does seem to be enjoying himself .  martin lawrence is a different story ; hes so uptight and verbally constipated that sitting through his improvised riffs are a trial .  movies like this are not about originality .  i know this .  they are about style and energy and synergy between actors .  i know this  too .  and yet  while watching bad boys  which its glamorous photography and impossibly exact stunt choreography  i felt fed up .  id seen con air  which despite being completely implausible  was still great fun  because it tried however feebly to put some new life into the mix .  bad boys is a dry run -- and overlong  too  clocking in at just over two hours with a lot more by-play than i felt could be justified .  i could write this movie .  you could write this movie .  many people have .  many people will continue to write this movie  over and over again .  other people will buy it from them  and make it  and we will pay money to see it .  more the fools we all .  in a terrifyingly prescient line from his book a scanner darkly  phil k . dick once mused that the mcdonaldburger ( as he called it ) would eventually eclipse money as the token of cultural and financial exchange .  one day we will all just sit in our living rooms and sell the same burger back and forth to each other .  the same could be said about this movie .  i have the sinking feeling were going to see it again .  soon .  , NEGin the first death wish movie  mild-mannered new york architect paul kersey  played by charles bronson  was avenging the death of his wife .  in the second  he was avenging his daughter .  in the third  he instigated small war in order to avenge the old friend .  fourth movie  on the other hand  begins with kersey doubting the point of his violent crusades and living the quiet life with his girlfriend karen  played by kay lenz .  however  since this is death wish movie  we know that sooner or later something bad is going to happen to the people kersey cares for .  this time karens teenage daughter dies of a crack overdose and kersey is forced to return to his old vigilante ways .  kerseys new targets  unlike the previous movies  arent the ordinary street punks but rich  heavily armed and well-connected drug dealers .  even such unstoppable killing machine like kersey needs some support  and it comes from the publisher nathan white ( john p . ryan )  determined to avenge the drug-related death of his own daughter .  whites plan is to make kersey kill major players in two rival drug dealing organisations and thus instigate the war between them .  the plan begins to take shape  but kerseys actions bring attention of two police detectives - reiner ( george dickerson ) and nozaki ( soon teck-oh ) .  fourth ( and  unfortunately  not the final ) installment in the death wish series  will probably remembered as the typical movie of cannon group  production company responsible for some of the worst cinematic trash of the last decade .  however  although some critics might argue  death wish 4 : the crackdown represents slight improvement over the death wish 3 . paul kersey  one of the most intriguing ( and potentially controversial ) characters of the 1970s  is still being dumbed down by mediocre script  and charles bronson really doesnt feel the need to put much effort in his acting .  however  the hand of a veteran director j . lee thompson seems more capable of michael winners and the action scenes seem slightly less surreal  although they still look cheap and repetitive and downright boring .  there are some attempts for the movie to have a plot between the numerous scenes of violence  and one of such attempts is a potentially interesting plot twist at the end .  the script even tries to fake some social conscience ( through criminally underused kay lenzs character ) and predates the war on drugs campaign that would inspire many hollywood products in next few years .  there are even some half-hearted attempts of humour - both intentional and unintentional  like in a scene where kersey assassinates mob figures by a wine bottle - but the quality of this movie is still far away from bronsons 1970s classics .   ( special note to x-philes : mith pilleggi  the actor who plays ad skinner in the x- files  could be seen in a small role of cannery lab foreman ) .  , NEGive never written a review for a movie i havent watched all the way through  but i had to make an exception with powder .  i was about forty-five minutes into this one at a friends house when he and his brother got into a huge shouting match that would have ended in violence had we not left the house .  so i never got to finish the movie and im sure as hell not going to pay three more bucks to watch half of a bad movie .  but i can at least get a partial review out of it  because i saw enough to know this one wasnt worth finishing in the first place .  the movie centers around a freaky teenager whos spent his entire life living in the cellar of his grandparents house .  when grandpa dies ( taking his department store down with him )  social worker mary steenburgen has to take powder ( first and middle names ?

 like i said  crawford is a lawyer with a bunch of russians after her .  billy baldwin ( or is it stephen ?  alec ?  adam ?  kim basinger ? ) is the police detective who has to save her life  time after time  chase after chase  explosion after explosion .  theres absolutely nothing original about this movie .  its every cop show of the 70s mixed with every action thriller of the 80s and every technology- exploitation movie of the 90s .  three decades of crap all in one place  driven further into the ground by crawfords complete lack of acting talent .  and its all completely predictable .  you know the mistakes baldwin and crawford are going to make before they make them  you know when the  sexual tension  will finally end up in them consummating the relationship  you know when the villains will capture crawford so baldwin has to rescue her in the climax and you know the movies going to suck from the first scene .  the plot isnt really explained until the end .  all we know is these russians have every detail about crawford in their computer .  in the words of one of the villains   we even know what size pantyhose she wears .    ( yeah  you and every 14-year-old boy in america . )  he goes on to add   we know more about her than she does .    ( _that_ i find very easy to believe . )  i hope you enjoyed those two sample dialogue quotes  because i wrote down plenty of other bad ones (  if it werent for me  youd still be pulling bananas out of your ass in cuba !  )  because  you see  fair game is not only a showcase for recycled action cliches and terrible acting  but also some seriously bad dialogue .  it all adds up to a really terrible movie that made me laugh in plenty of places i wasnt supposed to and grimace in places i was supposed to laugh .  one more thing fair game has against it is some awful comic relief .  would you laugh at a scene where crawford tortures a computer nerd with double entendres like  im very interested in _hard_ware  and other crap about playing with his joystick ?  i wouldnt  but not because im a computer nerd .  its just not funny .  crawfords only contribution to the information age are a few gif files floating around with her head on a nude traci lords body . . .  or was it jack lords body ?  ill leave you with the final line of dialogue in the movie .  the boat with all the russians has just blown up and baldwin and crawford are floating on a life raft .  crawford says woodenly   that was my clients boat you just blew up .  im filing a lawsuit against you .  youre in big trouble   or something to that effect  and baldwin replies smugly   what do i have to do to get out of it ?   they of course begin making out and the credits roll .  im not going to talk about how stupid the line is or how  if theyd really wanted to go for a bad closing line they would have had baldwin say   you think i could settle out of court ?   but i will tell you that  if anyone ever suggests you watch fair game with him or her  you quote the final line of the movie to that person :  what do i have to do to get out of it ?   serving america for over 1/50th of a century !  , NEGattention moviegoers : you are about to enter a meaning-free zone .  should the sound system malfunction during your viewing of 200 cigarettes  do not panic .  the film will work just as well as a silent movie .  chronicling the meaningless lives of vain  yuppie types  the movie covers the same ground as the wilt stillman films ( last days of disco  barcelona and metropolitan ) but without any of his acerbic wit and the inviting style of his writing .  first-time writer shana larsen makes the mistake of creating a couple of dozen characters and not giving any of them any depth .  there isnt one of these characters worth caring about .  the movie features such a cornucopia of hot young stars that it looks like a celluloid version of  people magazine .   among others  the movie features : ben affleck  casey affleck  david chappelle  janeane garofalo  gaby hoffmann  catherine kellner  courtney love  jay mohr  martha plimpton  christina ricci and paul rudd .  and unlike people magazine  the people speak  not that they have anything interesting to say .  its new years eve in 1981  and monica ( martha plimpton ) is preparing her big party .  structured as a series of relatively unrelated stories about her guests on the way to the party  director risa bramon garcia flits back and forth among her stars .  monicas apartment is in  noho   an area that one of the guests describes as  so cool  all of the poor people live there .   typical of the shallow couples in the movie are kevin ( paul rudd ) and his friend and would-be sexual partner lucy ( courtney love ) .  they argue about whether lucy is a slut or not since she sleeps with everyone  except him  of course .  she dares him to go immediately to a bathroom stall and have sex with her  which turns out to be neither erotic  funny or successful -- rather like the rest of the story .  the movie gets its title from the carton of cigarettes that lucy gives kevin for his new years eve birthday .    cigarettes are a shield against emotional interaction with other people   kevin later tells lucy in a snippet of dialog that sounds profound only outside the context of the movie .  another character  played by jay mohr  has a problem with his sexual triumphs .  every woman he beds falls deeply in love with him by the next morning .  when his latest conquest tells him of her affection for him  his response is  i like a lot of people .   as the movie finally draws to a close  the characters awaken from their post-party game of musical beds .  some have passed out early from alcohol abuse and remember little  while others actually have some clue as to what happened .  the movie itself is so forgettable that by the time you reach your car in the parking lot  all trace of the film will have vanished from your mind  which is probably the best thing that can be said about the movie .  200 cigarettes runs 1 : 40 .  it is rated r for profanity  sex and one dope smoking scene and would be acceptable for older teenagers .  , NEGi have nothing against unabashedly romantic films .  when done right  with at least slightly evident restraint  they can be engaging  sweeping  appealing .  but its a hell of a shame when someone botches it as badly as nora ephron botched sleepless in seattle  a hollow  boring romance that should appeal only to the most gullible of viewers ; the ones willing to buy into ephrons whiny views of life and romance .  tom hanks and meg ryan  two of hollywoods most likeable stars play sam baldwin and annie reed  repectively .  baldwins wife recently died and he moved to seattle with his son  jonah  seeking to get away from the familiar surroundings which remind him of his late spouse .  jonah senses tension and calls a talk radio show to tell the world about their problems .  sam seems ready to strangle his son for calling the show  but when he gets on the phone he begins pouring his heart out .  ephron has him do this so that annie reed ( meg ryan ) can hear it .  annie is a happy woman .  she is engaged to walter  an allergy-prone working man and seems to be perfectly content .  but after hearing sam the widower on the radio show  she becomes convinced that he is her destiny and is willing to risk her engagement for it .  five years after this movie hit theaters  hanks  ryan and ephron would team up again in the far better  although still sub-par romantic comedy youve got mail  which is about people who hate each other in real life falling in love on the internet .  at least that movie had a sense of spontaneity .  here it seems that the first one hundred minutes exist solely to set up for the last five .  the fact that sam and annie will finally meet is so excruciatingly obvious that everything else is perfunctory .  sleepless in seattle is full of wonderful performers ; from its two leads to supporting stars like bill pullman and rosie odonnell .  but none of them can save the film from being a bore .  its characters are dull and empty  its script isnt funny or particularly charming .  the script has a fundamental problem : annie gives up  for little reason  her life with walter to pursue  sleepless in seattle   whom she has never even seen .  its the kind of life decision that real people dont make  and its a major  unforgivable plausibility sacrifice .  in essence  this movies purpose is to head towards a goal that shouldnt even exist .  its a ten minute short film with ninety-five minutes of filler .  if you were to show me sleepless in seattle and i didnt have to review it  you could just call me  asleep in philadelphia .    ? 1999 eugene novikov&#137 ;  , NEGif youve seen the trailers or commercials  its rather difficult to really figure out what this movie has in store .  well  its hard to tell after watching the movie as well .  bruce willis is a resident of the future  and it is a rather bleak future .  the worlds population had disintigrated into a mere 200  000 and is no longer ruled by humans but animals .  the reason ?  in 1995  an organization called the army of the 12 monkeys contaminated the world with a pure virus  thus wiping out practically the worlds population in a mere month .  bruce willis character is one of the surviving few  but is enslaved by scientists  as are most of last living humans .  they barter his freedom by sending him on an assignment and having him do the ultimate task : go into the past  find the leader of the army of the 12 monkeys  and kill him .  well  this explanation didnt come easy .  although the movie is very thought provoking of us as a people  our future and the evilo in the world  as a story it is very confusing .  and dragging .  i know a movie isnt keeping my interest when i fidget in my seat or feel the need to look at my watch only to find that its only been an hour passed .  terry gilliam has a certain style that i realize many appreciate  and i havent watched his previous work brazil  but this movie felt like it took too long to tell and yet when one realizes the end is near because it is very easy to figure out  you wish it were more complex  and not to mention that the movie is depressing is the only reason why it did invoke emotion from me .  , NEGhouse on haunted hill ( 1999 ) starring taye diggs  geoffrey rush  ali larter  famke janssen  peter gallagher  bridgette wilson  max perlich  lisa loeb  james marsters  and chris kattan .  directed by william malone  written by dick beebe     house on haunted hill  initializes itself to the audience with a scene involving zombie-like mental patients attacking and murdering doctors in the goriest ways possible .  one doctor is killed instantly after having a pencil rammed completely through his neck .  a nurse has her head forced into a barrel of water .  these mobs of zombies presented are like those in previous b-horror flicks  with grunting noises and cadaverous movements .  except this time  at the end of the millenium  the film is given the power to show exactly how horrific these creatures can be .  in past horror films  the actual murder scenes are left out or not shown forcing the viewer to assume their own nasty bloody deaths for the hapless victims .    house on haunted hill  doesnt want their audience to have an imagination  everything is provided for them to watch and squirm  not think .  this nonsense violence thrown out of nowhere is unfortunately the most refreshing part about this film .    house on haunted hill   which is based on the 1958 film of the same title  introduces a handful of characters as quickly as it can  following the opening blood fest .  the film has no intention of providing character development or a laudable plot .  the aim here is to scare the audience with chilling  unexpected shots of blood  guts  and mayhem .  however  the film is neither scary nor unpredictable .  the plot involves five people who are dared to spend the night in a haunted house for one million dollars by an amusement park owner ( geoffrey rush ) .  each character is a failure in the external world and acknowledges that they would do anything for that money .  since the characters are immediately generalized as either greedy or caring  the expectations of who will survive or not is killed five minutes after you meet them .  the problem is that every character is not likable .  the two who come closest to being civilized are a womanizer ( taye diggs - who should be doing films a lot better than this with all of his talent ) and a businesswoman who accepts being womanized ( ali larter ) .  the characters presented are so annoying and pathetic  that it is hard to cheer for them or scream them .  the worst character in this film  or maybe in any film released this year  is chris kattans watson pritchett .  he spends the whole film whining about the spooky house in a tone so irritating and inappropriate  that he unintentionally begins to seem more evil than the house itself .  waiting for pritchett to die  was a strenuously difficult act to sit through .  the most humorous actor of the bunch is geoffrey rush playing steven price ( an homage to victor price who starred in the original ) .  playing the rich man who supposedly organized the party  he plays the role perfectly in a twisted way where it is obvious that he is up to something just by the expressions on his face .  however  rush is pretty much wasted in a confusing subplot involving a hateful marriage with evelyn price  played by famke janssen .  the main problem is that  house on haunted hill  is not scary .  to top off that huge disappointment  every actor was wasted and the script was completely ludicrous .  if the annoying characters and hilariously bad dialogue were intentionally underdeveloped ( similar to  deep blue sea  )  the goal for creating a creepy  suspenseful action film was completely missed .  , NEGfit for a ghouls night out  fat girl stands cast iron firm with the simplistic  fatuous  built-in excuse that its woman director is baring the harsh sexual realities of adolescent girls .  being a boy  i might not understand female behavior and am unequipped to analyze this particular pseudo-feminist coming-of-age story .  fair enough .  ill pretend to ignore the mannered posturing and health class 101  this is a no-no  dialogue when older teenage boy coaxes younger teenage girl to let him fuck her up the ass  speaking variations on  it wont hurt !   for a scene that seems to last at least ten minutes .  this is done almost entirely in an unbroken master shot that suggests unimaginative camerawork more than unblinking voyeurism .  they dare you to look away  without possessing the courage of allowing the children to actually sound like children ( theyre mouthpieces for writer-director catherine breillats one-note clinical politics ) .  rather than show an even-handed evaluation of the rigors of hormonal change  breillat ( previously responsible for the unwatchable romance ) wants to indulge in her hour of hate .  life is pain  highness .  get used to it .  shed find keen bedfellows in neil labute and todd solondz  other sultans of misanthropy who lack the balls to be earnest or honest .  for children  dealing with trauma and pain is complicated .  to bury that in sarcasm and academic theory feels cheap .  these would-be auteurs ( more like hauteurs ) havent earned the right to display suffering because they dont layer it in emotional truth ( as mike leigh does throughout naked and david lynch in several key scenes of blue velvet ) .  of course  there i go again comparing her to all these ( better ) male directors .  i dont care .  gender be damned  shes borderline inept .  braced for a knee-jerk reaction from the art house crowd ( mortified shock or compulsory applause will suffice )  writer-director catherine breillat may well accomplish her mission to get a rise out of people .  dont be fooled .  this grotesque oversimplification of awkward forays into passion may be quickly forgotten  remembered only as cold  boring  philosophically arid  and incompetently photographed .  the hyperviolent climactic sequence proves so extraordinarily misguided that i honestly wondered whether breillat had thrown in an impromptu dream sequence .  twelve years old  a bundle of dough with a sour pout  the superb ana ? s reboux plays the titular fat girl with a thousand yard stare and a frumpy insouciance .   ( her character is also named ana ? s . )  sitting at the table morosely slurping down a banana split  her presence is grounded and heartbreaking .  its a pity breillat never finds anything for her to do other than get defensive against her evil storybook sister  15-year old elena ( roxane mesquida )  for bringing a transitory boyfriend home to their shared room .  in this summer cottage  ana ? s has no escape from her position as stoic bedside observer to elenas depressing confusion of cheap sex with romance .  the boy in question  a smug italian college kid named fernando ( libero de rienzo ) is a real piece of work  claiming that the experience is a declaration of love while begging for a blowjob .  ana ? s doesnt receive any warmth from her largely absent parents  who join elena in making fun of her hefty girth .  she finds pleasure in wandering the beach alone  singing songs to herself  and swimming in the pool kissing the metal railing and pretending that its her paramour .  reboux commands the screen  but theres only so much a child actress can do recounting pretentious monologues to herself .  if one is inspired to rescue this young performer and place her in a better movie  at least she fares better than the other young talent asked to perform in intense love scenes that might feel justified if they werent so dramatically misguided .  this 83-minute vignette is something of a horror show  but breillat saves her nastiest poison for the very end .  on the long ride home punctuated by an uncomfortable silence between family members  gigantic trucks swerve by as the hour grows late .  will mommy fall asleep at the wheel ?  perhaps .  or maybe theres something deadlier around the corner  lying in wait to pounce upon the unsuspecting fat girl .  whats more  she might even like it .  with the intent of being unfair and unpredictable  placing her heroine in the most diabolical of corners in order to face up to impending adulthood  breillats extreme flourish of sadistic tawdriness reveals her as a master purveyor of contempt .  fat girl is a bitter pill indeed .  aka ?

 it is cheap  idiotic  unfunny  and not nearly as raunchy as i had heard it was .  at least some smut would have livened things up a bit .    porkys   tells the story ( if you can call it that ) of four clueless high school buddies  pee wee ( dan monahan )  billy ( mark herrier )  tommy ( wyatt knight )  and mickey ( roger wilson )  whom desperately want to get laid .  women  for the most part  are a mystery to them ( and in this movie  they are to the audience  as well  since all of them are written and acted as if they are aliens from a different planet ) .  their plan is sidetracked  however  when they venture out to a smarmy strip bar named porkys  which they are able to get into using fake ids .  after they pay the manager one-hundred bucks for three hookers  they are played a trick on and find themselves being dumped into the swamp below the building .  for these four teenage guys  this means war on porkys .    porkys   ultimately manages to fail on almost every possible level .  as a teenage sex-romp  it is not wild or amusing enough .  as a comedy  all of the jokes are predictable and fall flat .  as a look back at the 1950s  it is something  i suspect  most people from that era would want to bury deep in a grave .  and as a revenge movie  it is a crushing bore .  one of the most offensive things about   porkys   is how jaw-droppingly inaccurate the film is about teenagers .  the four main characters are not even attempted to be developed as characters  and we learn very little about them  except that they are horny and would probably feel more comfortable in a preschool .  that sure is revealing information .  the female characters fare even worse under the inaudacious screenplay and direction by bob clark .  the women are all treated as objects or comedy props  rather than real people .  for example  the two gym teachers  mrs . balbricker ( nancy parsons ) and honeywell ( kim cattrall )  only have one purpose  and that is to be made fun of .  mrs . balbricker is a gruff  no-holds-barred  overwight woman who will not stand for any foolishness  and  in one particularly embarrassing scene for all involved  honeywell has sex with a coach and barks like a dog .  there is no way to tell if parsons or cattrall are servicable actresses ( even though i have the suspicion they are not )  but one thing is for sure : they are asked to do things in this film that are not at all funny  only humiliating .  to prove how out-of-touch this so-called comedy is  compare it to other more serious 80s films about teenagers  and it looks even worse in comaprison .  any of the john hughes pictures  such as 1984s  sixteen candles   or  1985s  the breakfast club   put   porkys   at an even greater shame .  those films actually dealt with serious teen matters  but remained a great deal funnier  thanks to their bright and truthful writing .  and heck  if   porkys   wanted to be a teenage sex movie  id take 1982s  fast times at ridgemont high   or 1982s  the last american virgin   over this any day of the week .  director bob clark is not a bad director .  two years after he made   porkys   he directed the nostalgic holiday classic   a christmas story .   i would forgive him for this misfire  in fact  if it wasnt for the fact that he also wrote the screenplay .  just the thought that someone would actually sit down to write such a piece of garbage  and think that it was actually a film worth releasing unto the unsuspecting world  is actually a whole lot funnier than anything in   porkys .   , NEGokay  i just dont know why  but i seem to be getting this diversion to disney-made real-life actors movies . . . as  well as real-life acting tim allen movies .  i couldnt even make it through  the santa clause   so why did i even see this ?   ( just to make an idle point  i did like  toy story   but that was good ) also  i have this aversion to bad french farces  and if they remake them into american films .  well  this is my excuse : it was prom night  im not a prom person  my best friend and i impulsively went to the drive-ins where they were playing  grosse pointe blank  - wouldnt mind seeing it again - but i had to suffer through this first .  i agreed to go .  ugh .  in all fairness  i can say that at least this inane plot wasnt dreamed by an american .  it was originally a french film released in america under the pseudonym of  little indian  big city  ( french title -  un indien dans la ville  ) .  i stayed away from it like it was limburgher  and according to roger ebert  that was a good idea .  but i can only imagine how bad that must be if this is an improvement .  the stupid plot concerns a father who just learns he has a son from his current marriage .  let me clarify : his wife ( jobeth williams ) left him years ago  and i mean years - around 13 or so - and went to an island in the carribean or something .  he goes to her to finally get the divorce papers signed so he can remarry this . . . thing   ( played with an emphasis on over-done by lolita davidovitch  who is usually good ) .  she tells him he has a son as his boatman goes off .  he meets him  he has a weird name ( mimi seku  i think . . . or  as the bad joke goes -  mitsubishi  - laugh track cue )  he knows english  they fish  more bad jokes  pirhanna joke  the kid has a pet spider  he makes a promise to take him to the statue of liberty . . . you  know the drill .  now this is where the plot complicates ( well  complicates for this one  at least ) : the fish-out-of-water joke switches from tim allen on an island to his island son in new york city .  tim is a stock broker and his coffee profits are plunging because his laptop died and he wasnt able to communicate with his assistant or whatever he is - martin short .  a russian mob is tossed into the plot somewhere ( how come in every hokey french import  there is a mob ? ! )  tim learns a lesson of life from his son and we discover that cellular phones can operate on an island even though there are no sockets to recharge the batteries .  the story is crap  the jokes are hokey and not really funny  and the actors have to struggle to make it interesting .  but the material is so fowl that even a rewrite by quentin tarantino couldnt help it .  the whole time  i kept thinking that a grown person had to think this up and several more grown people had to do this .  at the end of filming  did they all scream out   weve made a great movie  guys !   i sure hope not .  big question to get from this film : why would someone want to remake what was billed as one of the worst films of all time if theyre just going to do it the exact same way ?  huh ?  my ( for some of the actors names and a joke or two that made me chuckle  i guess . . . okay   so i really feel bad for it  so i only gave it one star )  , NEG  the beach  is a structurally confusing film that i can only describe has having multiple personality disorder .  every forty minutes of this two-hour film begins with a new theme  virtually discarding what has been set up in the preceding act .  it starts off purposefully as a film about an innocent man seeking new thrills in a dangerous environment .  but then in the second act  the mood of the film abruptly changes and it becomes a story about a love triangle on an idyllic island paradise that evokes visions of  blue lagoon  .  forty minutes later  the mood changes once more  and it becomes a dumbed down version of  lord of the flies  where an isolated community is discovered  where their moral code touts maintaining a sense of bliss at all costs .  by the time its over  you can only scratch your head and wonder what this film was really meant to be about .  the main character of  the beach  is angst-ridden richard ( leonardo dicaprio ) .  he travels to the netherworld of bangkok where back alley merchants push their wares upon unsuspecting tourists and scantily clad women brazenly ask if youre looking for a good time .  richards voice-over tells the audience that he has come to this place because he is bored with his life and feels that one way to reinvigorate himself is to let go of the familiar and to enter into a world of the unknown .  this seedy environment is just what richard is looking for .  he checks into a fleabag hotel where he meets the crazed daffy ( robert carlisle ) .  he seems like a raving lunatic  obviously high from heavy drug use and looking as if he is afflicted with some sort of psychosis .  though his jagged behavior would distress most of us  richard listens to him as he speaks of a mysterious island that contains the most perfect beach that anyone has ever seen .  moreover  the island itself flourishes with enough hemp plants that can make a small city high for life .  captivated by the idea  he asks two other hotel guests to join him on his journey .  they are worldly etienne and the alluring francoise  who have also come to thailand for reasons similar to richards .  once they finally arrive at this paradise  however  the mood of the story shifts to richards growing desire for francoise .  this particular plot point is weak at best because there is absolutely no question in my mind that francoise will wind up with richard .  etienne is about as exciting as fluffy  white sand .  its odd that etienne never sees this coming  but paradise has a way of hiding potential threats just out of view .  and once the three stumble across the hidden community ( mood shift imminent )  more events transpire that depict its hidden dangers .  for example  there are marijuana fields close by patrolled by armed guards .  and the lagoon in which they swim invites the occasional shark .  there are several ideas that are introduced in  the beach  and each one could merit its own feature-length film .  theres the man vs . nature angle  the love triangle angle  and the utopia-gone-awry angle .  but the film meanders so tremendously that its entire purpose becomes blurred .  dicaprio  as a result  has an almost impossible time of trying to embody the different states of mind that he and the film goes through .  consequently  the audience has an equally difficult time trying to keep up .  , NEGthe most absurd remake of 1998 ?  its a toss up between gus van sants psycho and mighty joe young  the new disney picture based on the old rko picture .   ( i knew i was in trouble when a polished  computer-generated version of that famous rko logo appeared before the head credits . )  there is no great demand for another giant ape movie-make that ape movie  period .   ( witness the quick deaths of buddy  born to be wild and congo . )  and while this latest entry is inoffensive and watchable  its also an assembly line product through and through  lacking the charm and unpredictability of the jungle serials that partly inspired it .  theron is jill young : as a young girl in the wilds of africa  she befriended a baby gorilla after both their mothers were slain by poachers .  that baby gorilla ( nicknamed joe ) grows to immense proportions  and adult jill basically bides her time looking after him  playing hide and seek with him and guarding him against poachers .  enter conservationist greg ( paxton )  who convinces jill to move with joe to california  where they can protect him better in a controlled environment .  joe is restless at first ; no sooner does he finally settle in to the new place than those nasty poachers show up in l . a .  plotting joes demise .  suffice it to say  the movie could have been called  joe : ape in the city .   theron ( so good in devils advocate ) and paxton ( so good in the recent a simple plan ) are fine actors  but not fine enough to transcend the material  a paint-by-numbers script from the hack writers of superman iv and mercury rising .  the plot arguably borrows more from steven spielbergs the lost world than the 1949 original  with the computer-generated t-rex-i mean  joe-wreaking havoc on the busy streets for an encore ; the storytelling becomes especially lazy during this final third  with jill shouting   look  joes headed for the movie theatre !   followed by a shot of joe scaling manns chinese theater ; a moment later  jill shouts again something like  look  joes headed for an amusement park !  and what do you know  theres joe at the pallisades carnival  scaring the bejesus out of innocent thrillseekers .  the seams of last-minute edits to mighty joe young show-unrelated scenes are patched together with quick dissolves .  the movie sure feels uneven  regardless : act two is underdeveloped  while a little of joe smashing cars in act three goes a long  long way .  underwood ( tremors  speechless ) was perhaps not the director for the job ; even the plentiful  untamed landscape looks dull in his hands .   ( capturing the beauty of nature requires more than his point and shoot style . )  i did enjoy certain sequences  especially the demoliton of a black-tie dinner sequence ; and the prologue  however implausible  is touching .   ( as a tyke  joe acts just like e . t . ) rick bakers make-up effects and puppetry are outstanding  the real star of the show-yet  for all its technical flawlessness  the creature remains too grumpy and homicidal to love .   ( his facial expressions are variations on a scowl . )  to be fair  i saw mighty joe young in a cinema packed with wailing children-its a wonder i was able to decipher the dialogue .  its certainly not a film for very young kids-intense fighting scenes may scare them  while any time joes not on camera may bore them to tears .   ( note : older boys are more likely to be dazzled by therons colourful array of tank tops . )  i suspect bland mighty joe young is passable entertainment for a family outing  but they sure dont make ? em like they used to .  , NEGin 1990  the surprise success an unheralded little movie called ghost instantly rescued the moribund careers of its trio of above-the-title stars  patrick swayze  demi moore  and whoopi goldberg .  eight years later  moore and goldbergs careers arent exactly thriving  but they have had their share of screen successes since ; the same cant be said of swayze  who has just added yet another turkey to his resume with the aptly named black dog .  forget the mortal kombat movies--this trucksploitation flick is the closest the movies has come to video games .  good truck driver jack crews ( swayze ) must drive a cargo of illegal firearms from atlanta to new jersey .  along the way  jack and his crew of three run into a number of obstacles--such as a highway weigh station  evil truckers  and deadly uzi-firing motorcyclists .  every so often  like at the end of a video game  level  or  stage   the main baddie pops up : red ( meat loaf  fresh from the triumph of spice world )  who wants to steal the cache of guns .  just in case you forget his name or have trouble keeping track of whos driving what  all of reds vehicles  be it a pickup or a big rig  are painted--you guessed it--red .  i could go into more of the plot specifics ( such as jacks dream of having a nice home with his family  the past trauma that sent him to prison and cost him his trucking license  the fbi/atf crew tracking the cargo )  but they are of little importance .  all that matters to director kevin hooks and writers william mickelberry and dan vining are the obstacles jack confronts in his drive from point a to point b . but they fail at even this modest goal  for none of the highway chaos  as credibly staged as it is  is terribly interesting  let alone exciting .  once youve seen a couple of trucks bang against each other or a big rig explode the first time  youve seen it every time .  as dreary as black dog is as an entertainment  the saddest part about the film has nothing to do with what shows up onscreen ; its that swayze has to reduce himself to such work .  while far from the best of actors  he is certainly not horrible  and he is a charismatic presence .  i dont know if its his judgment or the dearth of quality job offers that leads him to involve himself with bombs such as black dog .  regardless  if he continues on this career track  could a tv series be far behind ?  , NEG
