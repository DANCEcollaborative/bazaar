Description=Implements Bayesian Logistic Regression for both Gaussian and Laplace Priors. For more information, see Alexander Genkin, David D. Lewis, David Madigan (2004). Large-scale bayesian logistic regression for text categorization.

Changes=This release fixes a problem with duplicate attribute names when using CV-based hyperparameter selection. CV-based hyperparameter selection was also non-deterministic due to random shuffling of instances seeded with the current system time. This release introduces an option for setting the random number seed value.
