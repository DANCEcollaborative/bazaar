# Description (required)
Description=Class for generating a pruned or unpruned C4.5 consolidated tree. Uses the Consolidated Tree Construction (CTC) algorithm: a single tree is built based on a set of subsamples. New options are added to the J48 class to set the Resampling Method (RM) for the generation of samples to be used in the consolidation process. For more information, see:<br/><br/>Jes&uacute;s M. P&eacute;rez and Javier Muguerza and Olatz Arbelaitz and Ibai Gurrutxaga and Jos&eacute; I. Mart&iacute;Â­n. "Combining multiple class distribution modified subsamples in a single tree". Pattern Recognition Letters (2007), 28(4), pp 414-422. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.patrec.2006.08.013" target="_blank">doi:10.1016/j.patrec.2006.08.013</a><br/><br/>A new way has been added to determine the number of samples to be used in the consolidation process which guarantees the minimum percentage, the coverage value, of the examples of the original sample to be contained by the set of built subsamples.
