Description=Class for building pace regression linear models and using them for prediction. <br/><br/>Under regularity conditions, pace regression is provably optimal when the number of coefficients tends to infinity. It consists of a group of estimators that are either overall optimal or optimal under certain conditions.<br/><br/>The current work of the pace regression theory, and therefore also this implementation, do not handle: <br/><br/>- missing values <br/>- non-binary nominal attributes <br/>- the case that n - k is small where n is the number of instances and k is the number of coefficients (the threshold used in this implmentation is 20)<br/><br/>For more information see:<br/><br/>Wang, Y (2000).
