# Description (required)
Description=This package contains an anonymization-filter, that is used as a preprocessing-tool. To make \
sure, no human being can be identified by the quasi-identifiers that occur in the data, \
one can perform an anonymization. The kind of anonymization is variable, as well as the strength. \
Therefore the datafly-algorithm is used. Mostly, it will not find the optimal solution, but it is the fastest. \
For l-diversity, there is a modified datafly-algorithm applied, that generalizes data as long as the \
l-diversity-criterion is not fulfilled.
