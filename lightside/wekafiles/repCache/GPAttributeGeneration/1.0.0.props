Description=This filter implements a genetic programming system to generate attributes suitable for a decision system such as J48. J48 is itself used to evolve polynomials of the original attributes that aid J48 in correctly classifying the dataset. Multi Objective Optimisation methods NSGA-II and Vector fitness that select on polynomial length, tree size and tree quality are also available. Based on previous work by Koza, Chris Hinde and Kalyanmoy Deb.
