# Description (required)
Description=A filter that applies the LOF (Local Outlier Factor) algorithm to compute an "outlier" score for each instance in the data. Can use multiple cores/cpus to speed up the LOF computation for large datasets. Nearest neighbor search methods and distance functions are pluggable.<br/><br/>For more information, see:<br/><br/> Markus M. Breunig, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Raymond T. Ng, Jorg Sander (2000).

Changes=Fixed a bug in the k-distance computation and a subtle issue with the parallel execution mode that resulted in slightly different results on some data sets when running in parallel mode vs sequential mode.
