# Description (required)
Description=This meta classifier creates a number of disjoint, stratified folds out of the data and feeds each chunk of data to a copy of the supplied base classifier. Predictions are made via majority vote, since all the generated base classifiers are put into the Vote meta classifier. <br/>Useful for base classifiers that are quadratic or worse in time behavior, regarding number of instances in the training data. <br/><br/>For more information, see: <br/>Ting, K. M., Witten, I. H.: Stacking Bagged and Dagged Models. In: Fourteenth international Conference on Machine Learning, San Francisco, CA, 367-375, 1997.

Changes=Code clean-up: generic type arguments, elimination of FastVector, clean-up of option handling.
