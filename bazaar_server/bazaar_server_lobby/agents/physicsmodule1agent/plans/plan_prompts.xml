        <text>You will need paper and a pen or pencil (or a good drawing program on your computer) to practice drawing ray diagrams in this activity. A ruler or straight edge will also be helpful. If you have these materials but need to fetch them, please do so now.</text>

        <text>Examine the image of a swimming pool in the Activity Plan tab. It shows a “1 FEET DEEP” sign on the side of a children’s pool. Discuss the following questions:|Why do some of the letters in “FEET DEEP” look different even though they are all painted the same size?|Why do you see multiple letters, even though each word is painted once?|Take five minutes to discuss possible explanations.</text>
    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A3">
        <text>Now based on your discussion, use ray diagrams to account for all the effects in this image. Take up to five minutes for each of you to draw your own ray diagrams on paper or using a drawing program on your computer. I encourage you to use a ruler or straight edge. If feasible, if you can create a public URL for your image, you may share your images for discussion by pasting the URL for your images into the Sharing Space tab at the left.</text>

    </prompt>
    
    <prompt strategy="task" id="PROMPT_STEP_A5">
        <text>Compare this diagram to your diagram(s). Resolve any discrepancies. Why does my ray diagram include multiple rays coming from the top and the bottom of each “letter”? Take a couple of minutes to compare and discuss.</text>

        <text>Your task is to determine which side of the foil (the flat or prism side) was facing the flashlight in experiment (a) and which in experiment (b). Use ray diagrams and calculations to justify your answer.|If feasible, if you can create a public URL for your image, you may share your image by pasting the URL for your images into the Sharing Space for discussion.|Remember it will help your learning if you can each draw your own diagram, even if you cannot share it now.</text>
