        <text> At WGU Academy, we like to set SMARTER goals. "SMARTER" stands for: Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-Bound, Evaluate, and Reward. | By setting SMARTER goals, we are setting ourselves up for success to fill in each piece of our pie. For example, instead of saying "I will do well in my English course," try setting a SMARTER goal such as "I will complete my Personal Narrative assignment in 1 week by setting aside one hour each evening to work on it. Along the way, I will evaluate my progress, and when I finish, I will celebrate with my family!"

You will answer with the question! In this case, it should be: "What is WGU?", or you may simply type: "WGU". Please alternate turns to give everyone an equal chance to play.
