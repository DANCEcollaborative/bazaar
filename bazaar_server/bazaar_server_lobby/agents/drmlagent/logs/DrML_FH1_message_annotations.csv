Load the .csv file on the Extract Features panel, extract the features, then run the cross validation on the Build Models panel. Then load the dev set on the Build Models panel as a supplied test set. Use Logistic regression to run the experiment, and then go to the Explore Results panel and set up for an error analysis.
