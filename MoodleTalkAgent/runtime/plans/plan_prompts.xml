    <prompt strategy="task" id="ABOUT_ACCOUNTABLE_TALK">
    	<text>The agent is listening for several kinds of triggers to start supporting students. |||
    		For example, David cares a lot about "Accountable Talk" style facilitation these days. ||| 
    		The provided AT example is configured for college chemistry. If you've turned on any of the revoice, agree, say_more, or explain conditions, 
    		try saying something like "boiling point increases with dipole moment." ||| 
    		(and then wait a little while, this behavior waits for other students to follow up before offering support.)</text>

    <prompt strategy="task" id="ABOUT_TUTORIALS">
