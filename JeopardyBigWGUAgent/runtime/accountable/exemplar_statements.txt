the weak intermolecular interaction force is a big contributor for nonpolar molecules
dipole energy is the main contributor for polar molecules
dispersion forces are a primary consideration for nonpolar molecules
ionic molecules boiling points are affected by the distance between them
molecular size has an effect on nonpolar boiling points
in non-polar molecules, the only force at work is the dispersion force
more branches limit the ability of molecules to interact across large surface areas
reduced surface area interaction results in a lower boiling point
ionic substances are held together by Coulomb forces
Coulomb force varies inversely with the sum of the radii
electrons are not shared equally in ionic compounds
ionic interactions are dominated by Coulomb forces
dipole moment has little to no influence on ionic compounds
boiling point increases with inter-ion forces
all else being equal, larger molecules have higher boiling points
the influence of dipole moment tends to be outweighed by dispersion
all else being equal, higher dipole moment should mean higher boiling point
hydrogen bonds can lead to higher boiling points
branched isomers have lower boiling points than non-branched isomers
substituting more electronegative atoms means higher dipole moment
dispersion forces increase with surface area
the dipole moment is related to the angle between atoms
dispersion forces can outweigh dipole-dipole interactions
dispersion forces can be large enough to dominate the boiling point considerations
dispersion forces can be dominated by ionic interactions
the boiling point tends to increase with molecular mass
substituting larger atoms increases the van der waals area
symmetric molecules have a lower dipole moment
some molecules can pack with greater surface contact
the boiling point is proportional to the strength of intermolecular attraction
the boiling point increases as intermolecular forces get stronger
strong intermolecular attraction leads to higher boiling points
molecules that strongly attract each other have high boiling points
the boiling point is proportional to strength of dispersion forces
larger dispersion forces lead to higher boiling points
stronger dispersion forces raise the boiling point
dispersion forces are proportional to polarizability
greater polarizability increases dispersion forces
polarizability is proportional to van der waals volume
larger van der waals volume implies greater polarizability
polarizability is greater when electrons are loosely held
large atoms with lots of electrons are easily polarized
polarizability increases with atom size
greater interaction area leads to larger dispersion forces
vanderwaals area increases with molecular mass
branching reduces the area of contact between molecules
unbranched isomers have a higher boiling point than branched isomers
more branches means weaker dispersion forces
branching leads to smaller dispersion forces
cyclic structures increase intermolecular contact area
cyclic structures have stronger dispersion forces than linear molecules
the boiling point is proportional to dipole-dipole force in polar molecules
larger dipole-dipole forces lead to higher boiling points in polar molecules
larger dipole moments lead to larger dipole-dipole forces
dipole-dipole forces are proportional to dipole moment
bond dipoles increase with electronegativity difference between bonded atoms
larger electronegativity differences lead to larger bond dipoles
the dipole moment is the vector sum of bond dipoles
the dipole moment of the whole molecule depends on all the bond dipoles
uncancelled bond dipoles lead to a net non-zero dipole moment
the dipole moment can be zero if the molecule's symmetry causes bond dipoles to cancel
molecules with inversion symmetry will have zero dipole moment
certain molecule symmetry causes bond dipoles to cancel
a non-uniform electron distribution leads to a permanent dipole moment
a highly symmetric electron distribution produces a dipole moment of zero
the Coulomb force is inversely proportional to the sum of ion radii
increasing ion radius leads to smaller Coulomb forces
smaller ions will have larger Coulomb forces
Coulomb forces are larger when ions are closer together
Coulomb forces decrease with increasing ion spacing
the Coulomb force is proportional to the charge on the ions
larger ion charge leads to larger Coulomb forces
doubly charged ions have larger Coulomb forces than singly charged ions
dipole moment does not affect Coulomb forces
Coulomb forces are independent of dipole moment
for ionic substances, boiling point does not depend on dipole moment
the boiling point of an ionic liquid is proportional to the Coulomb force
larger Coulomb forces lead to higher boiling points
larger forces between ions produce higher boiling points
boiling point goes up with increasing Coulomb force
the boiling point is proportional to the sum of all intermolecular forces
intermolecular forces all add together and influence the boiling point
the larger the sum of all intermolecular forces, the higher the boiling point
with alkanes, branching them reduces their van der Waals forces
more electrons -> more electron variation -> more van der Waals forces
if the molecules sort of 'compact', ie a cyclic molecule, they will also have a stronger dispersion force
the unbranched molecules have a higher boiling point than the branched ones
unbranched molecules have stronger vanderwaals force than branched ones
branching decreases the van der Waals forces, decreasing the boiling point
larger molecules have higher BP
the greater the difference in charge of each ion, the greater the boiling point
the difference in charge and the radius squared are the factors that influence the boiling point in ionic liquids
molar mass is most relevant to BP when the molecules have the same shape
the larger number of branches increases the BP for polar molecules
for nonpolar, more branches decreases BP
the factors influencing the boiling point are whether or not the molecules are branched and the size of the molecule
the more polar the molecule is, the stronger the attractive force to another molecule of the same type, and the harder it is to overcome that force
the radius of atoms involved and the charges affect the boiling point
when size increases, the force decreases, and so does the ionic-ness
when charge increases, the force increases, so ionic-ness increases
the dipoles would cancel each other out due to symmetry
if a molecule has a higher mass, it has a higher contact area with other molecules
lower dipole moment means lower intermolecular forces, which means lower boiling point
van der Waals area, dipole moment, and boiling point increase when you add fluorine
in the grand scheme of things, polarity is going to be more significant than dispersion
for non-polar molecules, the atomic size determines how big the intermolecular force is
the boiling point grows with van der Waals area
the "weak" intermolecular interation is actually not that weak, especialy for big atoms
the bigger intermolecular force is, the higher the boiling point is
hydrogen bonding has a large effect on these molecules
the dipole moment is determined by charge and distance
for nonpolar bonding, London dispersion forces (van der Waals force) increases as atomic size increases
as radius increases, the Coulomb force decreases
dispersion force increases with atomic size
the bigger molecular mass is, the higher the boiling point is 
additional branching reduces the dispersion force and the boiling point
dipole moments are based on the difference in electronegativity of the molecule
greater surface area = greater/stronger dispersion forces
a branched molecule has less surface area so therefore weaker dispersion forces in nonpolar molecules
the higher the dipole moment, the higher the boiling point
isomers with larger dipole moments tend to have higher boiling points
molecules with OH groups have even higher boiling points because they have hydrogen bonding
if it has a lower surface area, it will have a higher boiling point
the position of the oxygen will have more of an impact than the van der Waals force
the ionic factor tends to be more important than the dipole
the molecule can be completely symmetrical and that would end up in a net dipole of 0
a more massive molecule tends to have a higher boiling point
a greater difference in electronegativity makes the boiling point higher
for isomers, the type of branching and bonds affect the boiling point
as the surface area of the molecule increases, the van der waals force increases as well
the dipole moment increases when you add molecules - consequently, BP would increase as well
a larger molecule is more likely to have a dipole moment and have dipole-dipole interactions 
if two molecules have different chemical structures, then boiling point depends on dispersion forces
larger molecules require high temperatures to break intermolecular forces
the larger the physical molecule is in surface area, the more interactions there will be
