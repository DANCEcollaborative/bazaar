For example, instead of saying "I will do well in my first course," try setting a SMART goal such as "I will complete my first course in 6 weeks by setting aside one hour each evening to study. Along the way, I will reach out to my course instructor once per week to get assistance with material to ensure that I am prepared for the course assessment." </text>
