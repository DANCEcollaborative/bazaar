Description=This package contains CAAR learner CAAR predicts the target value of an input query by retrieving its top nearest neighbors, adjusting their values by applying ensemble of adaptation rules, and combining the adjusted values for building the final solution. CAAR utilizes context for retrieving adaptation rules used for adjusting the nearest neighbors' values. Context id defined as the rate of changes in the target values based on the changed in the input features.
