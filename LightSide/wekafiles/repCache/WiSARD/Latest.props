Description= A multi-class classification method based on the WiSARD weightless neural model.<br/><br/>A data-preprocessing filter allows to exploit WiSARD neural model training/classification capabilities on multi-attribute numeric data, whereas  WiSARD's  was historically restricted to binary pattern recognition.<br/><br/>For more information, see<br/><br/>De Gregorio M, Giordano, M.
