# Description (required)
Description=This package is a library-only package specific for Linux. It provides native libraries for linear algebra, including both a reference and system-tuned version. The system-tuned version will require libraries for BLAS, LAPACK and ARPACK compiled for your system to be available in your PATH. The native reference implementation should work out-of-the-box. After installing this package, several Weka schemes (such as linear regression and PCA) will use the native libraries for matrix operations.
