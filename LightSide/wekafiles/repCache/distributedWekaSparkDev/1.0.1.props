# Description (required)
Description=Development continuation of distributedWekaSpark. Adds access to source files (CSV, Parquet and Avro) via Spark DataFrames, and adds support for both desktop and distributed execution of MLlib algorithms. Provides Spark wrappers for the classes in distributedWekaBase. Includes generic Spark 1.6.3 libraries - To run against Hadoop/HDFS, it is necessary to delete all the libraries in ${user.home}/wekafiles/distributedWekaSpark/lib and copy in the spark-assembly-A.B.C-hadoopX.Y-Z.jar file that is bundled with the distribution of Spark compiled for your version of Hadoop.

# Changes in this release
Changes=Small change that adds support for specifying the jar file that contains core Weka via a java property (weka.jar.filename). Bug fix to make MLlibSparkContextManager thread safe.
