# Description (required)
Description=A Knowledge Flow plugin that provides a Knowledge Flow step that wraps around a Groovy script. The plugin generates a fully compilable template Groovy script that implements various Knowledge Flow interfaces. The user can fill in the methods that are necessary to accomplish the desired logic. The script is compiled at runtime and the Groovy component passes incoming events to the script and collects and passes on generated events.

Changes=Proxy step did not implement start() method - fixed. Added a template flow that uses a groovy script to load all the arff files in a user-specified directory.
