this needs to be 11,1
characters long and,1
it probably is but it,1
really is frustrating,1
coming up with strings that,1
are really long but alas,1
a test file must be a test,1
file and they are necessary,1
especially for this test even,1
though it is like only less,1
than a percent of test ,2
coverage increase overall,2
but I like it when ECLEMMA,2
shows me green lines as opposed,2
to yellow or god forbid red,2
Some days I feel quite happy,2
Testing other days it feels,2
monotonous but thats ok because,2
testing is an important part of,2
the software development cycle,2
I really hope these are long enough,2
or I might cry a little inside,2
These are really long strings tbh,2
I think they far surpass the 11 character,2
mark that I had estimated,2
Twinkle twinkle little eleven,2
character or longer star,2
how I wonder how long you are,2
up on my csv so high like the frustration,1
in my eye twinkle twinkle,1
little eleven character or longer star,1
how I wonder how long you are,1
last one WOOOOOHOOOOO,1
