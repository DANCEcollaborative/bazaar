notdetected,the characters are never more than sketches . . . which leaves any true emotional connection or identification frustratingly out of reach . 
notdetected,mattei's underdeveloped effort here is nothing but a convenient conveyor belt of brooding personalities that parade about as if they were coming back from stock character camp -- a drowsy drama infatuated by its own pretentious self-examination . 
notdetected,only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it's looking for .

notdetected,"in the telling of a story largely untold , bui chooses to produce something that is ultimately suspiciously familiar . "

notdetected,"watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence . "

notdetected,sex with strangers will shock many with its unblinking frankness . but what is missing from it all is a moral . what is the filmmakers' point ? why did they deem it necessary to document all this emotional misery ? 
notdetected,"you see robin williams and psycho killer , and you think , hmmmmm . you see the movie and you think , zzzzzzzzz . "

notdetected,a fascinating but choppy documentary . 
notdetected,scarcely worth a mention apart from reporting on the number of tumbleweeds blowing through the empty theatres graced with its company . 
notdetected,"the doofus-on- the-loose banter of welcome to collinwood has a cocky , after-hours loopiness to it . and as with most late-night bull sessions , eventually the content isn't nearly as captivating as the rowdy participants think it is . "

notdetected,don't even bother to rent this on video .

notdetected,this action-thriller/dark comedy is one of the most repellent things to pop up in a cinematic year already littered with celluloid garbage . 
notdetected,mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
notdetected,"no amount of arty theorizing -- the special effects are 'german-expressionist , ' according to the press notes -- can render it anything but laughable . "
notdetected,"blue crush follows the formula , but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling . "
notdetected,boyd's screenplay ( co-written with guardian hack nick davies ) has a florid turn of phrase that owes more to guy ritchie than the bard of avon .

notdetected,"a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight , and indicative of his , if you will , out-of-kilter character , who rambles aimlessly through ill-conceived action pieces . "
notdetected,"contrived , awkward and filled with unintended laughs , the film shows signs that someone other than the director got into the editing room and tried to improve things by making the movie go faster . "
notdetected,"starts out with tremendous promise , introducing an intriguing and alluring premise , only to fall prey to a boatload of screenwriting cliches that sink it faster than a leaky freighter . "

notdetected,"it's a very sincere work , but it would be better as a diary or documentary . "
notdetected,"once one experiences mr . haneke's own sadistic tendencies toward his audience , one is left with a sour taste in one's mouth , and little else . "
notdetected,"oops , she's really done it this time . that chirpy songbird britney spears has popped up with more mindless drivel . "

notdetected,"i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes . "
notdetected,aggressive self-glorification and a manipulative whitewash . stay for the credits and see a devastating comic impersonation by dustin hoffman that is revelatory . 
notdetected,none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest . 
notdetected,"as social exposé , skins has its heart in the right place , but that's not much to hang a soap opera on . "
notdetected,the whole film has this sneaky feel to it – as if the director is trying to dupe the viewer into taking it all as very important simply because the movie is ugly to look at and not a hollywood product . 
notdetected,"there's a bit of thematic meat on the bones of queen of the damned , as its origins in an anne rice novel dictate , but generally , it's a movie that emphasizes style over character and substance . "
notdetected,"the only way to tolerate this insipid , brutally clueless film might be with a large dose of painkillers . "
notdetected,"this one is certainly well-meaning , but it's also simple-minded and contrived . "
notdetected,coppola has made a film of intoxicating atmosphere and little else . 
notdetected,bad and baffling from the get-go . 
notdetected,a series of immaculately composed shots of patch adams quietly freaking out does not make for much of a movie . 
notdetected,"at a time when we've learned the hard way just how complex international terrorism is , collateral damage paints an absurdly simplistic picture . "

notdetected,"there's no excuse for following up a delightful , well-crafted family film with a computer-generated cold fish . "
notdetected,both the crime story and the love story are unusual . but they don't fit well together and neither is well told . 
notdetected,it's both sitcomishly predictable and cloying in its attempts to be poignant . 
notdetected,"other than a mildly engaging central romance , hospital is sickly entertainment at best and mind-destroying cinematic pollution at worst . "
notdetected,jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar .

notdetected,"a fragile framework upon which to hang broad , mildly fleshed-out characters that seem to have been conjured up only 10 minutes prior to filming . "
notdetected,"by the time the plot grinds itself out in increasingly incoherent fashion , you might be wishing for a watch that makes time go faster rather than the other way around . "
notdetected,"since lee is a sentimentalist , the film is more worshipful than your random e ! true hollywood story . "
notdetected,"wes craven's presence is felt ; not the craven of 'a nightmare on elm street' or 'the hills have eyes , ' but the sad schlock merchant of 'deadly friend . '"
notdetected,"sunshine state surveys the landscape and assesses the issues with a clear passion for sociology . but the cinematography is cloudy , the picture making becalmed . "
notdetected,it's one long bore . 
notdetected,it gets old quickly . watch barbershop again if you're in need of a cube fix--this isn't worth sitting through . 
notdetected,"it's leaden and predictable , and laughs are lacking . "
notdetected, . . . a cinematic disaster so inadvertently sidesplitting it's worth the price of admission for the ridicule factor alone . 
notdetected,"skip this dreck , rent animal house and go back to the source . "
notdetected,"the movie is a desperate miscalculation . it gives poor dana carvey nothing to do that is really funny , and then expects us to laugh because he acts so goofy all the time . "
notdetected,"we just don't really care too much about this love story . in that setting , their struggle is simply too ludicrous and borderline insulting . "
notdetected,the transporter bombards the viewer with so many explosions and side snap kicks that it ends up being surprisingly dull . 
notdetected,uzumaki's interesting social parallel and defiant aesthetic seems a prostituted muse . . . 
notdetected,"'men in black ii creates a new threat for the mib , but recycles the same premise . "
notdetected,"large budget notwithstanding , the movie is such a blip on the year's radar screen that it's tempting just to go with it for the ride . but this time , the old mib label stands for milder isn't better . "
notdetected,feels familiar and tired . 
notdetected,a retread of material already thoroughly plumbed by martin scorsese . 
notdetected,"instead of making his own style , director marcus adams just copies from various sources – good sources , bad mixture"
notdetected,criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama . 
notdetected,a bore that tends to hammer home every one of its points . 
notdetected,a story which fails to rise above its disgusting source material . 
notdetected,it's fitting that a movie as artificial and soulless as the country bears owes its genesis to an animatronic display at disneyland . 
notdetected,starts as an intense political and psychological thriller but is sabotaged by ticking time bombs and other hollywood-action cliches . 
notdetected,completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i'm not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage . 
notdetected,an uneven look into a grim future that doesn't come close to the level of intelligence and visual splendour that can be seen in other films based on philip k . dick stories . 
notdetected,horrible
notdetected,the disjointed mess flows as naturally as jolie's hideous yellow 'do . 
notdetected,"bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i haven't encountered since at least pete's dragon . "
notdetected,"an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . "
notdetected,makes a joke out of car chases for an hour and then gives us half an hour of car chases . 
notdetected,"as the sulking , moody male hustler in the title role , [franco] has all of dean's mannerisms and self-indulgence , but none of his sweetness and vulnerability . "
notdetected,the only thing to fear about  fear dot com  is hitting your head on the theater seat in front of you when you doze off thirty minutes into the film . 
notdetected,it's too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience . 
notdetected,"'synthetic' is the best description of this well-meaning , beautifully produced film that sacrifices its promise for a high-powered star pedigree . "
notdetected,it concentrates far too much on the awkward interplay and utter lack of chemistry between chan and hewitt .

notdetected," . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . "
notdetected,"doesn't get the job done , running off the limited chemistry created by ralph fiennes and jennifer lopez . "
notdetected,"a particularly joyless , and exceedingly dull , period coming-of-age tale . "
notdetected,it's impossible to indulge the fanciful daydreams of janice beard ( eileen walsh ) when her real-life persona is so charmless and vacant . 
notdetected,"…it wasn't the subject matter that ultimately defeated the film…it was the unfulfilling , incongruous ,  wait a second , did i miss something ?  ending . "
notdetected,this is a movie where the most notable observation is how long you've been sitting still . 
notdetected,"poor editing , bad bluescreen , and ultra-cheesy dialogue highlight the radical action . "
notdetected,"it's super- violent , super-serious and super-stupid . "
notdetected,"so earnest and well-meaning , and so stocked with talent , that you almost forget the sheer , ponderous awfulness of its script . "
notdetected,"just a string of stale gags , with no good inside dope , and no particular bite . "

notdetected,"morrissette has performed a difficult task indeed - he's taken one of the world's most fascinating stories and made it dull , lifeless , and irritating . "
notdetected,"granddad of le nouvelle vague , jean-luc godard continues to baffle the faithful with his games of hide-and-seek . "
notdetected,this loud and thoroughly obnoxious comedy about a pair of squabbling working-class spouses is a deeply unpleasant experience . 
notdetected,"it's better than the phantom menace . but unless you're an absolute raving star wars junkie , it isn't much fun . "
notdetected,"philosophically , intellectually and logistically a mess . "
notdetected,"a standard police-oriented drama that , were it not for de niro's participation , would have likely wound up a tnt original . "
notdetected,"coupling disgracefully written dialogue with flailing bodily movements that substitute for acting , circuit is the awkwardly paced soap opera-ish story . "
notdetected,hollywood ending just isn't very funny . 
notdetected,"though clearly well-intentioned , this cross-cultural soap opera is painfully formulaic and stilted . "
notdetected,a technical triumph and an extraordinary bore . 
notdetected,i can easily imagine benigni's pinocchio becoming a christmas perennial . coal isn't as easy to come by as it used to be and this would be a worthy substitute for naughty children's stockings . 
notdetected,two hours of junk . 
notdetected,"ends up being mostly about ravishing costumes , eye-filling , wide-screen production design and joan's wacky decision to stand by her man , no matter how many times he demonstrates that he's a disloyal satyr . "
notdetected,"self-congratulatory , misguided , and ill-informed , if nonetheless compulsively watchable . "
notdetected,"a clumsily manufactured exploitation flick , a style-free exercise in manipulation and mayhem . "
notdetected,"the whole affair , true story or not , feels incredibly hokey . . . [it] comes off like a hallmark commercial . "
notdetected,what's missing is what we call the 'wow' factor . 
notdetected,the nicest thing that can be said about stealing harvard ( which might have been called freddy gets molested by a dog ) is that it's not as obnoxious as tom green's freddie got fingered . 
notdetected," . . . tara reid plays a college journalist , but she looks like the six-time winner of the miss hawaiian tropic pageant , so i don't know what she's doing in here . . . "
notdetected,the young stars are too cute ; the story and ensuing complications are too manipulative ; the message is too blatant ; the resolutions are too convenient . 
notdetected,"normally , rohmer's talky films fascinate me , but when he moves his setting to the past , and relies on a historical text , he loses the richness of characterization that makes his films so memorable . "
notdetected,"i highly recommend irwin , but not in the way this film showcases him . "
notdetected,"it's been 13 months and 295 preview screenings since i last walked out on a movie , but resident evil really earned my indignant , preemptive departure . "
notdetected,this picture is mostly a lump of run-of-the-mill profanity sprinkled with a few remarks so geared toward engendering audience sympathy that you might think he was running for office -- or trying to win over a probation officer . 
notdetected,malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
notdetected,"though it goes further than both , anyone who has seen the hunger or cat people will find little new here , but a tasty performance from vincent gallo lifts this tale of cannibal lust above the ordinary . "
notdetected,"a blair witch- style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast . "

notdetected,it is too bad that this likable movie isn't more accomplished . the actors try hard but come off too amateurish and awkward . 
notdetected,"the plot has a number of holes , and at times it's simply baffling . "
notdetected,"an ill-conceived jumble that's not scary , not smart and not engaging . "
notdetected,"brainless , but enjoyably over-the-top , the retro gang melodrama , deuces wild represents fifties teen-gang machismo in a way that borders on rough-trade homo-eroticism . "
notdetected,gets bogged down by an overly sillified plot and stop-and-start pacing . 
notdetected,utter mush . . . conceited pap . 
notdetected,"  what john does is heroic , but we don't condone it ,  one of the film's stars recently said , a tortuous comment that perfectly illustrates the picture's moral schizophrenia . "
notdetected,"like coming into a long-running , well-written television series where you've missed the first half-dozen episodes and probably won't see the next six . "
notdetected,this is no  waterboy !  
notdetected,its generic villains lack any intrigue ( other than their funny accents ) and the action scenes are poorly delivered . 
notdetected,dripping with cliche and bypassing no opportunity to trivialize the material . 
notdetected,hard-core slasher aficionados will find things to like . . . but overall the halloween series has lost its edge . 
notdetected,stiff and schmaltzy and clumsily directed . 
notdetected,the story the movie tells is of brian de palma's addiction to the junk-calorie suspense tropes that have all but ruined his career . 
notdetected,too many improbabilities and rose-colored situations temper what could've been an impacting film . 
notdetected,"generic slasher-movie nonsense , but it's not without style . "
notdetected,"with tiny little jokes and nary an original idea , this sappy ethnic sleeper proves that not only blockbusters pollute the summer movie pool . "
notdetected,"it sticks rigidly to the paradigm , rarely permitting its characters more than two obvious dimensions and repeatedly placing them in contrived , well-worn situations . "
notdetected,ever see one of those comedies that just seem like a bad idea from frame one ? 
notdetected,"once ice-t sticks his mug in the window of the couple's bmw and begins haranguing the wife in bad stage dialogue , all credibility flies out the window . "
notdetected,"the best drug addition movies are usually depressing but rewarding . quitting , however , manages just to be depressing , as the lead actor phones in his autobiographical performance . "
notdetected,"it would be great to see this turd squashed under a truck , preferably a semi . "
notdetected,"in the end , all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is . "
notdetected,"for most movies , 84 minutes is short , but this one feels like a life sentence . "
notdetected,"while glover , the irrepressible eccentric of river's edge , dead man and back to the future , is perfect casting for the role , he represents bartleby's main overall flaw . "
notdetected,something has been lost in the translation . . . another routine hollywood frightfest in which the slack execution italicizes the absurdity of the premise . 
notdetected,"shatner is probably the funniest person in the film , which gives you an idea just how bad it was . "
notdetected,tries so hard to be quirky and funny that the strain is all too evident . 
notdetected,"as immaculate as stuart little 2 is , it could be a lot better if it were , well , more adventurous . "
notdetected,simply a re-hash of the other seven films . 
notdetected,"with jump cuts , fast editing and lots of pyrotechnics , yu clearly hopes to camouflage how bad his movie is . he fails . "
notdetected,i found myself more appreciative of what the director was trying to do than of what he had actually done . 
notdetected,a very depressing movie of many missed opportunities . 
notdetected,goes on and on to the point of nausea . 
notdetected,by turns numbingly dull-witted and disquietingly creepy . 
notdetected,"boy , has this franchise ever run out of gas . "
notdetected,"one problem with the movie , directed by joel schumacher , is that it jams too many prefabricated story elements into the running time . "
notdetected,the comedy is nonexistent . 
notdetected," . . . a bland , pretentious mess . "
notdetected,"it's a pedestrian , flat drama that screams out 'amateur' in almost every frame . "
notdetected,a bland animated sequel that hardly seems worth the effort . 
notdetected,it's not just the vampires that are damned in queen of the damned -- the viewers will feel they suffer the same fate . 
notdetected,"if religious films aren't your bailiwick , stay away . otherwise , this could be a passable date film . "
notdetected,this is the case of a pregnant premise being wasted by a script that takes few chances and manages to insult the intelligence of everyone in the audience . 
notdetected,the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
notdetected,"stuffy , full of itself , morally ambiguous and nothing to shout about . "
notdetected,"it is most of the things costner movies are known for ; it's sanctimonious , self-righteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it . "
notdetected,don't let the subtitles fool you ; the movie only proves that hollywood no longer has a monopoly on mindless action . 
notdetected,chai's structure and pacing are disconcertingly slack . 
notdetected,to be oblivious to the existence of this film would be very sweet indeed . 
notdetected,"the director , with his fake backdrops and stately pacing , never settles on a consistent tone . "
notdetected,one just waits grimly for the next shock without developing much attachment to the characters . 
notdetected,"instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story's emotional thrust . "
notdetected,the director seems to take an unseemly pleasure in [the characters'] misery and at the same time to congratulate himself for having the guts to confront it . 
notdetected,this dubious product of a college-spawned ( colgate u . ) comedy ensemble known as broken lizard plays like a mix of cheech and chong and chips .

notdetected,"it's so mediocre , despite the dynamic duo on the marquee , that we just can't get no satisfaction . "
notdetected,"slapstick buffoonery can tickle many a preschooler's fancy , but when it costs a family of four about $40 to see a film in theaters , why spend money on a dog like this when you can rent a pedigree instead ? "
notdetected, . . . turns so unforgivably trite in its last 10 minutes that anyone without a fortified sweet tooth will likely go into sugar shock . 
notdetected,the notion that bombing buildings is the funniest thing in the world goes entirely unexamined in this startlingly unfunny comedy .

notdetected,"i've always dreamed of attending cannes , but after seeing this film , it's not that big a deal . "
notdetected,"the vintage is pure '87 , with a halfhearted twist on its cautionary message : fatal attraction = don't have an affair with a nutjob ; unfaithful = don't if you're married to one . "
notdetected,a workshop mentality prevails .

notdetected,like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything's in place but something's just a little off-kilter . 
notdetected,the affectionate loopiness that once seemed congenital to demme's perspective has a tough time emerging from between the badly dated cutesy-pie mystery scenario and the newfangled hollywood post-production effects .

notdetected,"partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show . "
notdetected,the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
notdetected,"portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama . "
notdetected,"a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz . "
notdetected,"jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot . "

notdetected,"a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment . "
notdetected,like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste . 
notdetected,it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt . 
notdetected,the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .

notdetected,"shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . "
notdetected,i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it . 
notdetected,"complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort"
notdetected,"though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining . "
notdetected,"something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously . "

notdetected,"on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality . "

notdetected,"bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . "
notdetected,may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
notdetected,"if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter . "
notdetected,not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .

notdetected,davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is . 
notdetected,"the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves . "
notdetected,"the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult . "

notdetected,"the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays . "
notdetected,"perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . "
notdetected,verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies . 
notdetected,"mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script . "
notdetected,an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
notdetected,"skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt . "
notdetected,who needs love like this ? 
notdetected,hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story . 
notdetected,"returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy . "
notdetected,exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise . 
notdetected,"trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . "
notdetected,"mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity . "
notdetected,"it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks . "
notdetected,"whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy . "
notdetected,it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment . 
notdetected,a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes . 
notdetected,nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay . 
notdetected,i'm just too bored to care . 
notdetected,"irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater . "
notdetected,not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid . 
notdetected,"as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear . "
notdetected,attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience . 
notdetected,it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
notdetected,nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
notdetected,scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
notdetected,a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel . 
notdetected,like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ? 
notdetected,this is so bad . 
notdetected,"even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping . "
notdetected,"i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example . "
notdetected,"prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle . "
notdetected,this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs . 
notdetected,"the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle . "
notdetected,"it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence . "
notdetected,van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
notdetected,"a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers . "
notdetected,the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither . 
notdetected,every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife . 
notdetected,"scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight ! "
notdetected,"is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? "
notdetected,there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television . 
notdetected,"however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust . "
notdetected,"the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse . "
notdetected,"some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny . "
notdetected,even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor . 
notdetected,"comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears ,  crossroads  instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns . "
notdetected,it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so
notdetected,"it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . "
notdetected,"the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . "
notdetected,"sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn . "
notdetected,"schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character . "
notdetected,demands too much of most viewers . 
notdetected,the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on . 
notdetected,it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did . 
notdetected,"shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme . "
notdetected,aggravating and tedious . 
notdetected,the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear . 
notdetected,"the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt . "
notdetected,"for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor . "
notdetected,"a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy . "
notdetected,"meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie . "
notdetected,the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue . 
notdetected,has the feel of an unedited personal journal . 
notdetected,remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more . 
notdetected,"cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed . "
notdetected,this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated . 
notdetected,"it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than  confessions of a dangerous mind .  "
notdetected,the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one . 
notdetected, . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves . 
notdetected,"unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller . "
notdetected,"the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes . "
notdetected,lacks depth . 
notdetected,"most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most . "
notdetected,"there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to . "
notdetected,audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones . 
notdetected,under-rehearsed and lifeless
notdetected,"the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next . "
notdetected,you can practically smell the patchouli oil . 
notdetected,to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career . 
notdetected,"the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes . "
notdetected,"an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach"
notdetected,"this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions . "
notdetected,consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g
notdetected,"another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh . "
notdetected,"laughably , irredeemably awful . "
notdetected,moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance . 
notdetected,"there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate . "
notdetected,"the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden . "
notdetected,"when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done . "
notdetected,"tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool . "
notdetected,"i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then . "
notdetected,"uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things . "
notdetected,"all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags . "
notdetected,"the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound . "
notdetected,"if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan . "
notdetected,"stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd . "
notdetected,"it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish . "
notdetected,culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character . 
notdetected,"in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context . "
notdetected, . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie . 
notdetected,"a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek . "
notdetected,"shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity . "
notdetected,imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs . 
notdetected,"soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself . "
notdetected,"a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable . "
notdetected,the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors
notdetected,"it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb . "
notdetected,"the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script . "
notdetected,"it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile . "
notdetected,proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie . 
notdetected,"well , it does go on forever . "
notdetected,this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd . 
notdetected,topkapi this is not . 
notdetected,"if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ? "
notdetected,ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls . 
notdetected,equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama . 
notdetected,"i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s . "
notdetected,"while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy . "
notdetected,"if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now . "
notdetected,"a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect . "
notdetected,"guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs . "
notdetected,audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school . 
notdetected,to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist . 
notdetected,"it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning . "
notdetected,credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter . 
notdetected,"i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve . "
notdetected,"for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together . "
notdetected,"an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views . "
notdetected,"a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison . "
notdetected,"yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature . "
notdetected,"it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part . "
notdetected,"this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself . "
notdetected," . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle . "
notdetected,"literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes . "
notdetected,arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie . 
notdetected,"anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss . "
notdetected,chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about . 
notdetected,a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world . 
notdetected,unwieldy contraption . 
notdetected,the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously . 
notdetected,marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie . 
notdetected,the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film . 
notdetected,"if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead . "
notdetected,"so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically . "
notdetected,this is junk food cinema at its greasiest . 
notdetected,"when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper . "
notdetected,"most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future . "
notdetected,"the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business . "
notdetected,you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic ! 
notdetected,a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards . 
notdetected,this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring . 
notdetected,"before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon . "
notdetected,"the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin . "
notdetected,"instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ? "

notdetected,"even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship . "
notdetected,"if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce . "
notdetected,the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored . 
notdetected,"serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour . "

notdetected,"though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear . "

notdetected,i'd give real money to see the perpetrators of chicago torn apart by dingoes . 
notdetected,"movies like this are selling the old european candor , the old wink of 'bold' revelation . but in 2002 , such revelations wilt . "
notdetected,the timing in nearly every scene seems a half beat off . 
notdetected,"i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time . "
notdetected,a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy . 
notdetected,flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind . 
notdetected,"even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness . "
notdetected,the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence . 
notdetected,despite some gulps the film is a fuzzy huggy . 
notdetected,mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness
notdetected,"a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad . "
notdetected,the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .

notdetected,"truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before . "

notdetected,the movie gets muted and routine . 
notdetected,the issue of faith is not explored very deeply
notdetected,"it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest . "

notdetected,"feels less like it's about teenagers , than it was written by teenagers . "
notdetected,ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue . 
notdetected,a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas . 
notdetected,"elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one . "
notdetected,"it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school . "
notdetected," in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction . "
notdetected,"this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does . "
notdetected,"the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging . "
notdetected,"a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie . "
notdetected,"men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . . "

notdetected,there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production . 
notdetected,"this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long . "

notdetected,"for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero . "
notdetected,a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie . 
notdetected,if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public . 
notdetected,"frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music . "
notdetected,"places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller . "
notdetected,"stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type . "
notdetected,a very average science fiction film . 
notdetected,"undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters . "
notdetected,how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us . 
notdetected,the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap . 
notdetected,"the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama . "
notdetected,"the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy . "

notdetected,"for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear . "
notdetected,un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image . 
notdetected,"when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever . "
notdetected,what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about . 
notdetected,"while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that . "
notdetected,"yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ? "
notdetected,"preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure . "
notdetected,calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls . 
notdetected,"none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter . "
notdetected," . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise . "
notdetected,"as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame . "
notdetected,"splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings . "
notdetected, . . . has virtually no script at all . . . 
notdetected,"will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly . "
notdetected,"this kind of dark comedy requires a delicate , surgical touch . but director danny devito and screenwriter adam resnick ( remember cabin boy ? ) just pound away . "
notdetected,"at times , however , dogtown and z-boys lapses into an insider's lingo and mindset that the uninitiated may find hard to follow , or care about . "
notdetected,"rather quickly , the film falls into a soothing formula of brotherly conflict and reconciliation . "
notdetected,screenwriters scott abbott and michael petroni have turned rice's complex akasha into a cartoon monster . 
notdetected,"the writers , director wally wolodarsky , and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity : kappa rho alpha phi . "
notdetected,bad beyond belief and ridiculous beyond description . 
notdetected,"the new faces are interesting , but the old story isn't , especially when it starts to seem more improvised than scripted . "
notdetected,most of the action setups are incoherent . 
notdetected,"liman , of swingers and go , makes his big-budget action film debut something of a clunker as he delivers a long , low-heat chase , interrupted by a middling car chase . "
notdetected, . . . surprisingly inert for a movie in which the main character travels back and forth between epochs . 
notdetected,the problem isn't that the movie hits so close to home so much as that it hits close to home while engaging in such silliness as that snake-down-the-throat business and the inevitable shot of schwarzenegger outrunning a fireball . 
notdetected,"dreary , highly annoying . . . 'some body' will appeal to no one . "
notdetected,a prison comedy that never really busts out of its comfy little cell . 
notdetected,"there's something deeply creepy about never again , a new arrow in schaeffer's quiver of ineptitudes . "
notdetected,"the problem with concept films is that if the concept is a poor one , there's no saving the movie . sorry , charlie"
notdetected,a painfully leaden film destined for pre-dawn cable television slots . 
notdetected,"blessed with immense physical prowess he may well be , but ahola is simply not an actor . and in truth , cruel as it may sound , he makes arnold schwarzenegger look like spencer tracy . "
notdetected,the cartoon that isn't really good enough to be on afternoon tv is now a movie that isn't really good enough to be in theaters . 
notdetected,shocking only in that it reveals the filmmaker's bottomless pit of self-absorption . 
notdetected,"this pep-talk for faith , hope and charity does little to offend , but if saccharine earnestness were a crime , the film's producers would be in the clink for life . "
notdetected,"all ends well , sort of , but the frenzied comic moments never click . "
notdetected,"if this is the danish idea of a good time , prospective tourists might want to consider a different destination -- some jolly country embroiled in a bloody civil war , perhaps . "
notdetected,formula 51 is so trite that even yu's high-energy action stylings can't break through the stupor . 
notdetected,"only a few minutes elapse before the daddy of all slashers arrives , still with the boiler suit and white mask , which look remarkably clean for a guy who has been mass-murdering since 1978 but has never been seen doing laundry . "
notdetected,"when the painted backdrops in a movie are more alive than its characters , you know you're in trouble . "
notdetected,"[two] fairly dull -- contrasting and interlocking stories about miserable scandinavian settlers in 18th-century canada , and yuppie sailboaters in the here and now . "
notdetected,the film is really not so much bad as bland . 
notdetected,the central story lacks punch . 
notdetected,"though ganesh is successful in a midlevel sort of way , there's nothing so striking or fascinating or metaphorically significant about his career as to rate two hours of our attention . "
notdetected,"this may be the dumbest , sketchiest movie on record about an aspiring writer's coming-of-age . "
notdetected,"succumbs to the same kind of maudlin , sentimental mysticism that mars the touched by an angel school of non-god spiritual-uplift movies . "
notdetected,a harmless and mildly amusing family comedy . 
notdetected,what was subtle and mystifying in the novella is now broad and farcical . 
notdetected,the kids often appear to be reading the lines and are incapable of conveying any emotion . 
notdetected,"  men in black ii ,  has all the earmarks of a sequel . the story is less vibrant , the jokes are a little lukewarm , but will anyone really care ? "
notdetected,sucking all the 'classic' out of robert louis stevenson's treasure island and filling the void with sci-fi video game graphics and disney-fied adolescent angst . . . 
notdetected,"this 72-minute film does have some exciting scenes , but it's a tad slow . "
notdetected,"while super troopers is above academy standards , its quintet of writers could still use some more schooling . "
notdetected,"a mix of velocity and idiocy , this ruinous remake lacks the brawn -- and the brains -- of the 1970s original . "
notdetected,"the low-budget full frontal was one of the year's murkiest , intentionally obscure and self-indulgent pictures , and solaris is its big-budget brother . "
notdetected,"the plot is very clever , but boyd weighs it down with too many characters and events , all intertwined and far too complicated to keep track of . "
notdetected,the film seems all but destined to pop up on a television screen in the background of a scene in a future quentin tarantino picture
notdetected,"a free-for-all of half-baked thoughts , clumsily used visual tricks and self-indulgent actor moments . "
notdetected,apallingly absurd . . . the chemistry or lack thereof between newton and wahlberg could turn an imax theater into a 9  black and white portable tv . 
notdetected,a well acted and well intentioned snoozer . 
notdetected,"the smug , oily demeanor that donovan adopts throughout the stupidly named pipe dream is just repulsive . "
notdetected,"must-see viewing for anyone involved in the high-tech industry . others may find it migraine-inducing , despite moore's attempts at whimsy and spoon feeding . "
notdetected,"despite its good nature and some genuinely funny moments , super troopers suffers from a bad case of arrested development . "
notdetected,it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
notdetected,i watched the brainless insanity of no such thing with mounting disbelief . 
notdetected,"this limp gender-bender-baller from a first-time director and rookie screenwriter steals wholesale from that 1982's tootsie , forgetting only to retain a single laugh . "
notdetected,"kwan makes the mix-and- match metaphors intriguing , while lulling us into torpor with his cultivated allergy to action . "
notdetected,"while obviously an extremely personal work , it remains inextricably stuck in an emotionally unavailable rut . "
notdetected,"any movie this boring should be required to have ushers in the theater that hand you a cup of coffee every few minutes . like a marathon runner trying to finish a race , you need a constant influx of liquid just to get through it . "
notdetected,i loved looking at this movie . i just didn't care as much for the story . 
notdetected,has all the poignancy of a hallmark card and all the comedy of a gallagher stand-up act . 
notdetected,"it doesn't do the original any particular dishonor , but neither does it exude any charm or personality . "
notdetected,fear dot com is so rambling and disconnected it never builds any suspense . 
notdetected,"a gorgeous , somnolent show that is splendidly mummified and thoroughly unsurprising . "
notdetected,a semi-autobiographical film that's so sloppily written and cast that you cannot believe anyone more central to the creation of bugsy than the caterer had anything to do with it . 
notdetected,"it feels like a community theater production of a great broadway play : even at its best , it will never hold a candle to the original . "
notdetected,the film apparently takes place in a fantasy world where people in hotel hallways recite poetry in voice-over instead of speaking to each other . 
notdetected,the element of surprise might be the only thing femme fatale has going for it . 
notdetected,"it's the kind of movie you can't quite recommend because it is all windup and not much of a pitch , yet you can't bring yourself to dislike it . "
notdetected,"maybe it's asking too much , but if a movie is truly going to inspire me , i want a little more than this . "
notdetected,"a graceless , witless attempt at mating some like it hot with the wwii espionage thriller . "
notdetected,the story and characters are nowhere near gripping enough . 
notdetected,"based on a david leavitt story , the film shares that writer's usual blend of observant cleverness , too-facile coincidence and slightly noxious preciousness . "
notdetected,"just like every other seagal movie , only louder and without that silly ponytail . "
notdetected,"to enjoy this movie's sharp dialogue and delightful performance by jolie and burns , you have to gloss over the no sense ending . "
notdetected,national lampoon's van wilder could be the worst thing to come out of national lampoon since class reunion
notdetected,"this is a great subject for a movie , but hollywood has squandered the opportunity , using it as a prop for warmed-over melodrama and the kind of choreographed mayhem that director john woo has built his career on . "
notdetected,ecks this one off your must-see list . 
notdetected,"overall , the film misses the brilliance of jelinek's novel by some way . it settles for being merely grim . "
notdetected,"the irwins emerge unscathed , but the fictional footage is unconvincing and criminally badly acted . "
notdetected,"it's not thirsty , consuming passion which drives this movie . no , it's the repetition of said behavior , and so children of the century is more mindless love than mad , more grating and boring than anything else . "
notdetected,"just because it really happened to you , honey , doesn't mean that it's interesting to anyone else . "
notdetected,"just like the deli sandwich : lots of ham , lots of cheese , with a sickly sweet coating to disguise its excrescence until just after ( or during ) consumption of its second half . "
notdetected,every so often a movie comes along that confirms one's worse fears about civilization as we know it . the new guy is one of them . 
notdetected,this isn't a  friday  worth waiting for . 
notdetected,everything that's worthwhile about collision course can already be seen on television . 
notdetected,"if this movie belonged to a sorority , it would be called beta alpha delta . "
notdetected,"not a cheap slasher flick , as the subject matter would suggest , but is a little like a nature film , showing a patient predator and his foolish prey . "
notdetected,uneasy mishmash of styles and genres . 
notdetected,"herzog is obviously looking for a moral to his fable , but the notion that a strong , unified showing among germany and eastern european jews might have changed 20th-century history is undermined by ahola's inadequate performance . "
notdetected,"all in all , there's only one thing to root for : expulsion for everyone . "
notdetected,beyond a handful of mildly amusing lines . . . there just isn't much to laugh at . 
notdetected,secret ballot is too contemplative to be really funny . 
notdetected,the film's center will not hold . 
notdetected,"myers never knows when to let a gag die ; thus , we're subjected to one mind-numbingly lengthy riff on poo and pee jokes after another . "
notdetected,too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise . 
notdetected,"a great ending doesn't make up for a weak movie , and crazy as hell doesn't even have a great ending . "
notdetected,"dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter . "
notdetected,"its over-reliance on genre conventions , character types and formulaic conflict resolutions crushes all the goodwill it otherwise develops . "
notdetected,"as an actor , the rock is aptly named . "
notdetected,a mostly tired retread of several other mob tales . 
notdetected,"i wish i could say  thank god it's friday  , but the truth of the matter is i was glad when it was over . "
notdetected,nothing about it fits . 
notdetected,"as it abruptly crosscuts among the five friends , it fails to lend the characters' individual stories enough dramatic resonance to make us care about them . "
notdetected,"somehow we're meant to buy that this doting mother would shun her kids , travel to one of the most dangerous parts of the world , don fatigues and become g . i . jane . "
notdetected,the cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big . . . and the setting remains indistinct . 
notdetected,consider the title's clunk-on-the-head that suggests the overtime someone put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread concept . 
notdetected,the movie quickly drags on becoming boring and predictable . i tried to read the time on my watch . 
notdetected,"the film makes a tragic error by going on for too long , trying to mirror every subsequent event in chinese history : war , revolution , communism , etc . "
notdetected,"johnson has , in his first film , set himself a task he is not nearly up to . "
notdetected,"ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what's the point ? '"
notdetected,"the two leads are almost good enough to camouflage the dopey plot , but so much naturalistic small talk , delivered in almost muffled exchanges , eventually has a lulling effect . "
notdetected,"the film meant well in its horse tale about freedom , but wasn't able to reach the heart because it was too overbearing . "
notdetected,"the movie is as far as you can get from racy , to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain ; it has a dull , costumey feel . "
notdetected,"once the audience figure out what's being said , the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care . "
notdetected,there's nothing provocative about this film save for the ways in which it studiously avoids provoking thought . 
notdetected,"it seems just a long , convoluted ploy to get men into drag -- period drag , no less . "
notdetected,"the premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in , but the film must have been written . . . in the thrall of a vicious hangover . "
notdetected,"even by dumb action-movie standards , ballistic : ecks vs . sever is a dumb action movie . "
notdetected,the film equivalent of a toy chest whose contents get scattered over the course of 80 minutes . 
notdetected,just a bloody mess . 
notdetected,creepy but ultimately unsatisfying thriller . 
notdetected,"martin scorsese cria um espetáculo visual que não possui alma - um filme esteticamente belo , mas emocionalmente frio . "
notdetected,"you would be better off investing in the worthy emi recording that serves as the soundtrack , or the home video of the 1992 malfitano-domingo production . "
notdetected,has something to say . . . but it is a statement and issue worthy of a much more thoughtfulness and insight than a melodramatic and wholly predictable thriller . 
notdetected,"bears is bad . not 'terrible filmmaking' bad , but more like , 'i once had a nightmare like this , and it's now coming true' bad . "
notdetected,"as is most commonly case with projects such noble and lofty ambitions , the film is less poetic than simply pretentious . "
notdetected,"george , hire a real director and good writers for the next installment , please . "
notdetected,"for a film about two mismatched buddies , crystal and de niro share little screen time and even less chemistry . "
notdetected,"however clever nelson has been in providing variation within the confines of her structure and staging , the question remains whether this should , indeed , have been presented as a theatrical release . "
notdetected,"extreme oops - oops , ops , no matter how you spell it , it's still a mistake to go see it . "
notdetected,what could and should have been biting and droll is instead a tepid waste of time and talent . 
notdetected,"what will , most likely , turn out to be the most repellent movie of 2002 . "
notdetected, . . . too dull to enjoy . 
notdetected,"a morality tale whose thought-provoking potential is hampered by a made-for-tv look , rigid performances and an asinine 'twist' that brazenly rips off the sixth sense . "
notdetected,here's a self-congratulatory 3d imax rah-rah . 
notdetected,"eastwood is an icon of moviemaking , one of the best actors , directors and producers around , responsible for some excellent work . but even a hero can stumble sometimes . "
notdetected,a sophomoric exploration of 'life problems' most people solved long ago -- or at least got tired of hearing people kvetch about . 
notdetected,"it's all very cute , though not terribly funny if you're more than six years old . "
notdetected,the impact of the armenian genocide is diluted by too much stage business in the modern day . 
notdetected,[u]nrelentingly stupid . 
notdetected,going to the website may be just as fun ( and scary ) as going to the film . 
notdetected,"lacking gravitas , macdowell is a placeholder for grief , and ergo this sloppy drama is an empty vessel . leave these flowers unpicked -- they're dead on the vine . "
notdetected,"admirable , certainly , but not much fun to watch . for caine lovers only . "
notdetected,"a shambles of a movie--visually unattractive , unbearably loud and utterly silly . . . its hilarity is completely unintentional . "
notdetected,"de niro may enjoy the same free ride from critics afforded to clint eastwood in the lazy bloodwork . but like bruce springsteen's gone-to-pot asbury park , new jersey , this sad-sack waste of a movie is a city of ruins . "
notdetected,"no , it's not nearly as good as any of its influences . "
notdetected,"a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . "
notdetected,"the rest of the plot is impossible to explain without blowing whatever tension there is , although it's more comedy than suspense de palma creates . "
notdetected,"human nature talks the talk , but it fails to walk the silly walk that distinguishes the merely quirky from the surreal . "
notdetected,"city by the sea is the cinematic equivalent of defensive driving : it's careful , conscientious and makes no major mistakes . but what saves lives on the freeway does not necessarily make for persuasive viewing . "
notdetected,the marquis de sade couldn't have been as dull a person as this film makes him out to be . 
notdetected,what could have been a neat little story about believing in yourself is swamped by heavy-handed melodrama . 
notdetected,the cast is uniformly excellent . . . but the film itself is merely mildly charming . 
notdetected,"drives for the same kind of bittersweet , conciliatory tone that three seasons achieved but loses its way in rhetorical excess and blatant sentimentality . "
notdetected,a bigger holiday downer than your end-of-year 401 ( k ) statement .

notdetected,"a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery . "
notdetected,it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring . 
notdetected,"[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness . "

notdetected,"this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them ! "

notdetected,"it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness . "
notdetected,"all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness . "
notdetected,"a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash . "

notdetected,"boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie . "
notdetected,can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality . 
notdetected,"predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle . "

notdetected,presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency . 
notdetected,"we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat . "

notdetected,"the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring . "
notdetected,"much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché . "

notdetected,"told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject . "

notdetected,"if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it . "
notdetected,"with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable  formula 51  is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger . "
notdetected,sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot . 
notdetected,a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about . 
notdetected,"adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '"
notdetected,this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost . 
notdetected,the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment . 
notdetected,de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back . 
notdetected,"slap me , i saw this movie . "

notdetected,"just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay . "
notdetected,oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material
notdetected,"the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . "
notdetected,"carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '"
notdetected,so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
notdetected,"in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate . "
notdetected,starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés . 
notdetected,sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .

notdetected,the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break . 
notdetected,"well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery . "
notdetected,"so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat . "

notdetected,wobbly senegalese updating of  carmen  which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai
notdetected,it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long .

notdetected,what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
notdetected,"a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films . "

notdetected,the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects . 
notdetected,"the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it . "
notdetected,the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role . 
notdetected,"the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas . "
notdetected,what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is ! 
notdetected,the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film . 
notdetected,opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen . 
notdetected,"despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless . "
notdetected,"it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill"
notdetected,the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste . 
notdetected,it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay . 
notdetected,"terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable . "

notdetected,"the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life . "
notdetected,"a quaint , romanticized rendering . "
notdetected,"what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song . "
notdetected,the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness . 
notdetected,a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted . 
notdetected,woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them . 
notdetected,"she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . . "

notdetected,only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience . 
notdetected,"a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target . "
notdetected,[l]ame and unnecessary . 
notdetected,"a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art . "
notdetected,"it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy ! "

notdetected,"reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down . "
notdetected,"the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen . "
notdetected,"co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short . "
notdetected,"if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it . "

notdetected,"if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way . "
notdetected,comes off like a bad imitation of the bard . 
notdetected,what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough . 
notdetected,an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film . 
notdetected,horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible . 
notdetected,a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people . 
notdetected,slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by . 
notdetected,"if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing . "
notdetected,the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value . 
notdetected,i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered . 
notdetected,little more than a well-mounted history lesson .

notdetected,the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen . 
notdetected,sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .

notdetected,how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts . 
notdetected,"when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w . "
notdetected,"there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies . "
notdetected,"the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film . "
notdetected,"it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast . "
notdetected,the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker . 
notdetected,"content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance . "
notdetected,"the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness . "
notdetected,"its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life . "
notdetected,[seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels . 
notdetected,it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread . 
notdetected,"neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price . "
notdetected,"if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh . "
notdetected,what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors . 
notdetected,"the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not . "
notdetected,it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere . 
notdetected,"boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect . "
notdetected,"it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does . "
notdetected,has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick . 
notdetected,"like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen . "
notdetected,something must have been lost in the translation . 
notdetected,becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring . 
notdetected,"in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses . "
notdetected,chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy . 
notdetected,"rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical . "
notdetected,"  the tuxedo  should have been the vehicle for chan that  the mask  was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes . "
notdetected,"for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming . "
notdetected,"the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing . "
notdetected,what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie . 
notdetected,"plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king . "
notdetected,city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery . 
notdetected,"whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes . "

notdetected,"i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was . "
notdetected,what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate . 
notdetected,"doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films . "
notdetected,the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea . 
notdetected,"nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy . "

notdetected,no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild . 
notdetected,"eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good . "
notdetected,strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression . 
notdetected,"there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes . "
notdetected,"it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's . "
notdetected,there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups . 
notdetected,"we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments . "
notdetected,"like many such biographical melodramas , it suffers from the awkwardness that results from adhering to the messiness of true stories . "
notdetected,there is nothing redeeming about this movie . 
notdetected,"the film has [its] moments , but they are few and far between . "
notdetected,a dreary indulgence . 
notdetected,"i was trying to decide what annoyed me most about god is great . . . i'm not , and then i realized that i just didn't care . "
notdetected,derailed by bad writing and possibly also by some of that extensive post-production reworking to aim the film at young males in the throes of their first full flush of testosterone . 
notdetected,deserves high marks for political courage but barely gets by on its artistic merits . 
notdetected, . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental . 
notdetected,brosnan's finest non-bondish performance yet fails to overcome the film's manipulative sentimentality and annoying stereotypes . 
notdetected,"a film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms , waiting for happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact . "
notdetected,"to me , it sounds like a cruel deception carried out by men of marginal intelligence , with reactionary ideas about women and a total lack of empathy . "
notdetected,tsai may be ploughing the same furrow once too often . 
notdetected,"flashy gadgets and whirling fight sequences may look cool , but they can't distract from the flawed support structure holding equilibrium up . "
notdetected,zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted . 
notdetected,[a] crushing disappointment . 
notdetected,"how can such a cold movie claim to express warmth and longing ? in truth , it has all the heart of a porno flick ( but none of the sheer lust ) . "
notdetected,nicks and steinberg match their own creations for pure venality -- that's giving it the old college try . 
notdetected,episode ii-- attack of the clones is a technological exercise that lacks juice and delight . 
notdetected,the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
notdetected,[denis'] bare-bones narrative more closely resembles an outline for a '70s exploitation picture than the finished product . 
notdetected,"wanders all over the map thematically and stylistically , and borrows heavily from lynch , jeunet , and von trier while failing to find a spark of its own . "
notdetected,viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
notdetected,overall tomfoolery like this is a matter of taste . 
notdetected,the mantra behind the project seems to have been 'it's just a kids' flick . ' translation : 'we don't need to try very hard . '
notdetected,"in all the annals of the movies , few films have been this odd , inexplicable and unpleasant . "
notdetected,"it takes a really long , slow and dreary time to dope out what tuck everlasting is about . so here it is : it's about a family of sour immortals . "
notdetected,an essentially awkward version of the lightweight female empowerment picture we've been watching for decades
notdetected,the author's devotees will probably find it fascinating ; others may find it baffling . 
notdetected,"writer-director walter hill and co-writer david giler try to create characters out of the obvious cliches , but wind up using them as punching bags . "
notdetected,"there's a scientific law to be discerned here that producers would be well to heed : mediocre movies start to drag as soon as the action speeds up ; when the explosions start , they fall to pieces . "
notdetected,a cockeyed shot all the way . 
notdetected,"lush and beautifully photographed ( somebody suggested the stills might make a nice coffee table book ) , but ultimately you'll leave the theater wondering why these people mattered . "
notdetected,"unfortunately , one hour photo lives down to its title . thanks largely to williams , all the interesting developments are processed in 60 minutes -- the rest is just an overexposed waste of film . "
notdetected,"cold , sterile and lacking any color or warmth . "
notdetected,the film is undone by anachronistic quick edits and occasional jarring glimpses of a modern theater audience watching the events unfold . 
notdetected,seems like someone going through the motions . 
notdetected,"for a film about explosions and death and spies ,  ballistic : ecks vs . sever  seems as safe as a children's film . well , in some of those , the mother deer even dies . "
notdetected,"wallace gets a bit heavy handed with his message at times , and has a visual flair that waxes poetic far too much for our taste . "
notdetected,"impostor doesn't do much with its template , despite a remarkably strong cast . "
notdetected,"wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy , but it isn't as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally mean-spirited . "
notdetected,"choppy , overlong documentary about 'the lifestyle . '"
notdetected,one sloughs one's way through the mire of this alleged psychological thriller in search of purpose or even a plot . 
notdetected,"a film which presses familiar herzog tropes into the service of a limpid and conventional historical fiction , when really what we demand of the director is to be mesmerised . "
notdetected,it's a fanboy 'what if ? ' brought to life on the big screen . 
notdetected,the story itself is actually quite vapid . 
notdetected,"it's a hellish , numbing experience to watch , and it doesn't offer any insights that haven't been thoroughly debated in the media already , back in the dahmer heyday of the mid-'90s . "
notdetected,wait for pay per view or rental but don't dismiss barbershop out of hand . 
notdetected,"a few zingers aside , the writing is indifferent , and jordan brady's direction is prosaic . "
notdetected,"each scene drags , underscoring the obvious , and sentiment is slathered on top . "
notdetected,"would've been nice if the screenwriters had trusted audiences to understand a complex story , and left off the film's predictable denouement . then nadia's birthday might not have been such a bad day after all . "
notdetected,"one of those staggeringly well-produced , joylessly extravagant pictures that keep whooshing you from one visual marvel to the next , hastily , emptily . "
notdetected,"nair just doesn't have the necessary self-control to guide a loose , poorly structured film through the pitfalls of incoherence and redundancy . "
notdetected,"enthusiastically taking up the current teen movie concern with bodily functions , walt becker's film pushes all the demographically appropriate comic buttons . "
notdetected,it's the funniest american comedy since graffiti bridge . 
notdetected,"that neither protagonist has a distinguishable condition hardly matters because both are just actory concoctions , defined by childlike dimness and a handful of quirks . "
notdetected,what starts off as a possible argentine american beauty reeks like a room stacked with pungent flowers . 
notdetected,the project's filmmakers forgot to include anything even halfway scary as they poorly rejigger fatal attraction into a high school setting . 
notdetected,"in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve's novel proved too difficult a text to 'lick , ' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast . "
notdetected,solondz may well be the only one laughing at his own joke
notdetected,"stitch is a bad mannered , ugly and destructive little * * * * . no cute factor here… . not that i mind ugly ; the problem is he has no character , loveable or otherwise . "
notdetected,"deep down , i realized the harsh reality of my situation : i would leave the theater with a lower i . q . than when i had entered . "
notdetected,a really funny fifteen-minute short stretched beyond its limits to fill an almost feature-length film . 
notdetected,"aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcom . com or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea , the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand . "
notdetected,"it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment . "
notdetected,"for its 100 minutes running time , you'll wait in vain for a movie to happen . "
notdetected,a work that lacks both a purpose and a strong pulse . 
notdetected,a faster paced family flick . upper teens may get cynical . smaller numbered kidlets will enjoy . 
notdetected,"while this film has an 'a' list cast and some strong supporting players , the tale -- like its central figure , vivi -- is just a little bit hard to love . "
notdetected,it's a road-trip drama with too many wrong turns . 
notdetected,"most fish stories are a little peculiar , but this is one that should be thrown back in the river . "
notdetected,"it's all gratuitous before long , as if schwentke were fulfilling a gross-out quota for an anticipated audience demographic instead of shaping the material to fit the story . "
notdetected,"  i blame all men for war ,  [the warden's daughter] tells her father . the movie is about as deep as that sentiment . "
notdetected,it's fitfully funny but never really takes off . 
notdetected,"i've seen some bad singer-turned actors , but lil bow wow takes the cake . "
notdetected,"by halfway through this picture i was beginning to hate it , and , of course , feeling guilty for it . . . . then , miracle of miracles , the movie does a flip-flop . "
notdetected,"for all the complications , it's all surprisingly predictable . "

notdetected,"a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution . "
notdetected,every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here . 
notdetected,"snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this . "
notdetected,[the film's] taste for  shock humor  will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers . 
notdetected,any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things . 
notdetected,"if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles . "
notdetected,"hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares . "
notdetected,"interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring . "
notdetected,"things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content . "
notdetected,it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion .

notdetected,"the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut ! "
notdetected,demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack . 
notdetected,"the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up . "
notdetected,it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us . 
notdetected,"it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher . "
notdetected,"ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing . "
notdetected,far more enjoyable than its predecessor . 
notdetected,[gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience . 
notdetected,"full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature . "
notdetected,a ragbag of cliches . 
notdetected,this rough trade punch-and-judy act didn't play well then and it plays worse now . 
notdetected,a reality-snubbing hodgepodge . 
notdetected,"the three leads produce adequate performances , but what's missing from this material is any depth of feeling . "
notdetected,"it's possible that something hip and transgressive was being attempted here that stubbornly refused to gel , but the result is more puzzling than unsettling . "
notdetected,this painfully unfunny farce traffics in tired stereotypes and encumbers itself with complications . . . that have no bearing on the story . 
notdetected,"short and sweet , but also more than anything else slight… tadpole pulls back from the consequences of its own actions and revelations . "
notdetected,"has its moments , but it's pretty far from a treasure . "
notdetected,what more can be expected from a college comedy that's target audience hasn't graduated from junior high school ? 
notdetected,"collateral damage offers formula payback and the big payoff , but the explosions tend to simply hit their marks , pyro-correctly . "
notdetected,the plan to make enough into ‘an inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller' has flopped as surely as a soufflé gone wrong . 
notdetected,"instead of letting the laughs come as they may , lawrence unleashes his trademark misogyny -- er , comedy -- like a human volcano or an overflowing septic tank , take your pick . "
notdetected,you know that ten bucks you'd spend on a ticket ? just send it to cranky . we don't get paid enough to sit through crap like this . 
notdetected,"an even more predictable , cliche-ridden endeavor than its predecessor . "
notdetected,the whole thing plays like a tired tyco ad . 
notdetected,the film doesn't show enough of the creative process or even of what was created for the non-fan to figure out what makes wilco a big deal . 
notdetected,"the soupy end result has the odd distinction of being playful without being fun , too . "
notdetected,"no , i don't know why steven seagal is considered a star , nor why he keeps being cast in action films when none of them are ever any good or make any money . "
notdetected,"even by the intentionally low standards of frat-boy humor , sorority boys is a bowser . "
notdetected,"one well-timed explosion in a movie can be a knockout , but a hundred of them can be numbing . proof of this is ballistic : ecks vs . sever . "
notdetected,"halfway through , however , having sucked dry the undead action flick formula , blade ii mutates into a gross-out monster movie with effects that are more silly than scary . "
notdetected,"weighted down with slow , uninvolving storytelling and flat acting . "
notdetected,"we can't accuse kung pow for misfiring , since it is exactly what it wants to be : an atrociously , mind-numbingly , indescribably bad movie . unfortunately , we'd prefer a simple misfire . "
notdetected,there isn't one moment in the film that surprises or delights . 
notdetected,'wouldn't it be nice if all guys got a taste of what it's like on the other side of the bra ? '
notdetected,the movie is essentially a series of fleetingly interesting actors' moments . 
notdetected,"most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . "
notdetected,"this movie , a certain scene in particular , brought me uncomfortably close to losing my lunch . "
notdetected,"the secrets of time travel will have been discovered , indulged in and rejected as boring before i see this piece of crap again . "
notdetected,"smug , artificial , ill-constructed and fatally overlong . . . it never finds a consistent tone and lacks bite , degenerating into a pious , preachy soap opera . "
notdetected,chelsea walls is a case of too many chefs fussing over too weak a recipe . 
notdetected,"every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least four times . every joke is repeated at least--annoying , isn't it ? "
notdetected,comes across as a fairly weak retooling . 
notdetected,the lousy lead performances . . . keep the movie from ever reaching the comic heights it obviously desired . 
notdetected,"its and pieces of the hot chick are so hilarious , and schneider's performance is so fine , it's a real shame that so much of the movie -- again , as in the animal -- is a slapdash mess . "
notdetected,"[creates] the worst kind of mythologizing , the kind that sacrifices real heroism and abject suffering for melodrama . "
notdetected,"the movie resolutely avoids all the comic possibilities of its situation , and becomes one more dumb high school comedy about sex gags and prom dates . "
notdetected,earnest and heartfelt but undernourished and plodding . 
notdetected,a sugar-coated rocky whose valuable messages are forgotten 10 minutes after the last trombone honks . 
notdetected,romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
notdetected,has all the complexity and realistic human behavior of an episode of general hospital . 
notdetected,"an acceptable way to pass a little over an hour with moviegoers ages 8-10 , but it's unlikely to inspire anything more than a visit to mcdonald's , let alone some savvy street activism . "
notdetected,"[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now . "
notdetected,an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound . 
notdetected,mildly amusing . 
notdetected,not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans . 
notdetected,"the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension . "
notdetected,"watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen . "
notdetected,the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters . 
notdetected,fairly run-of-the-mill . 
notdetected,merchant hasn't directed this movie so much as produced it -- like sausage . 
notdetected,"the film has a nearly terminal case of the cutes , and it's neither as funny nor as charming as it thinks it is . "
notdetected,more a gunfest than a rock concert . 
notdetected,"it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni . "
notdetected,a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here . 
notdetected,mildly entertaining . 
notdetected,it's not original enough . 
notdetected,a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect . 
notdetected,terrible . 
notdetected,little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games . 
notdetected,degenerates into hogwash . 
notdetected,a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive . 
notdetected,"julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent . "
notdetected,"an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' . "
notdetected,the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile . 
notdetected," . curiously , super troopers suffers because it doesn't have enough vices to merit its 103-minute length . "
notdetected,so bland and utterly forgettable that it might as well have been titled generic jennifer lopez romantic comedy . 
notdetected,i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back . 
notdetected,"it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its  dead wife communicating from beyond the grave  framework is even remotely new or interesting . "
notdetected,"it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive . "
notdetected,all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 . 
notdetected,…passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road . 
notdetected,"although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out . "
notdetected,"after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music . "
notdetected,"no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive . "

notdetected,a meatballs for the bare-midriff generation . 
notdetected,"well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy . "
notdetected,"seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors . "
notdetected,formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip . 
notdetected,everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel . 
notdetected,"a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun . "
notdetected,"the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) . "
notdetected,disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel . 
notdetected," coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock . "
notdetected,"anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy . "
notdetected,how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them . 
notdetected,"they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes . "
notdetected,collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence . 
notdetected,"the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy . "
notdetected,"attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident . "
notdetected,"obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque . "
notdetected,the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters . 
notdetected,michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously . 
notdetected,"ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it . "
notdetected,"potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults . "
notdetected," . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites . "
notdetected,"a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour . "
notdetected,most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement . 
notdetected,"in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in . "
notdetected,rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations . 
notdetected,"mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative . "
notdetected,plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line . 
notdetected,new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . . 
notdetected,"amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way . "
notdetected,"yes , spirited away is a triumph of imagination , but it's also a failure of storytelling . "
notdetected,a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie . 
notdetected,a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga . 
notdetected,"whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain . "
notdetected,"an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility . "
notdetected,"the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing . "
notdetected,the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch . 
notdetected,"unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters . "
notdetected,"each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time . "
notdetected,"except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion . "
notdetected,will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting . 
notdetected,the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung . 
notdetected,"for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking . "
notdetected,knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail . 
notdetected,"mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money . "
notdetected,"it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely . "
notdetected,"holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals . "
notdetected,"for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words  radical  or  suck  into a sentence . "
notdetected,there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale . 
notdetected,an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle . 
notdetected,"it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue . "
notdetected,"i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't . "
notdetected,dreary tale of middle-class angst
notdetected,"for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either . "
notdetected,"[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd . "
notdetected,"lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else . "
notdetected,"like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way . "
notdetected,"an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film . "
notdetected,"[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation . "
notdetected,it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey . 
notdetected,friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite . 
notdetected,its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
notdetected,a decidedly mixed bag . 
notdetected,meandering and confusing . 
notdetected,"there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels . "
notdetected,"ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin . "
notdetected,"not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending . "
notdetected,"the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality . "
notdetected,"everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented . "
notdetected,just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ? 
notdetected,sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films . 
notdetected,"hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film . "
notdetected,this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better . 
notdetected,the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it . 
notdetected,bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda . 
notdetected, . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet . 
notdetected,"frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes . "
notdetected,how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ? 
notdetected,"the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull . "
notdetected,"handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé . "
notdetected,"  sorority boys  was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad . "
notdetected,"a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder"
notdetected,"paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 . "
notdetected,"it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles . "
notdetected,"an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original . "
notdetected,"often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy . "
notdetected,"certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire . "
notdetected,"elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side . "
notdetected,"showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again . "
notdetected,all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams . 
notdetected,this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations . 
notdetected,"i have no problem with  difficult  movies , or movies that ask the audience to meet them halfway and connect the dots instead of having things all spelled out . but first , you have to give the audience a reason to <b>want</b> to put for that effort , and  i"
notdetected,"been there , done that . . . a thousand times already , and better . "
notdetected,"what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism . "
notdetected,"sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness . "
notdetected,"fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers . "
notdetected,barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality . 
notdetected,"none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens . "
notdetected,the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics . 
notdetected,"'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '"
notdetected,at once overly old-fashioned in its sudsy plotting and heavy-handed in its effort to modernize it with encomia to diversity and tolerance . 
notdetected,the trashy teen-sleaze equivalent of showgirls . 
notdetected,"while the production details are lavish , film has little insight into the historical period and its artists , particularly in how sand developed a notorious reputation . "
notdetected,a crass and insulting homage to great films like some like it hot and the john wayne classics . 
notdetected,"what's the most positive thing that can be said about the new rob schneider vehicle ? well , it's not as pathetic as the animal . "
notdetected,"with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . "
notdetected,the problematic characters and overly convenient plot twists foul up shum's good intentions . 
notdetected,what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel . 
notdetected,doesn't add up to much . 
notdetected,"has all the values of a straight-to-video movie , but because it has a bigger-name cast , it gets a full theatrical release . "
notdetected,"with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s . "
notdetected,"it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time . "
notdetected,"loud , silly , stupid and pointless . "
notdetected,"mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie . "
notdetected,a yawn-provoking little farm melodrama . 
notdetected,"did no one on the set have a sense of humor , or did they not have the nerve to speak up ? "
notdetected,crummy
notdetected,"seriously , rent the disney version . "
notdetected,"as david letterman and the onion have proven , the worst of tragedies can be fertile sources of humor , but lawrence has only a fleeting grasp of how to develop them . "
notdetected,"like its parade of predecessors , this halloween is a gory slash-fest . it can't escape its past , and it doesn't want to . "
notdetected,  abandon  will leave you wanting to abandon the theater . 
notdetected,"problem is , we have no idea what in creation is going on . "
notdetected,"a live-action cartoon , a fast-moving and cheerfully simplistic 88 minutes of exaggerated action put together with the preteen boy in mind . "

notdetected,"what the audience feels is exhaustion , from watching a movie that is dark ( dark green , to be exact ) , sour , bloody and mean . "
notdetected,"director hoffman , his writer and kline's agent should serve detention"
notdetected,"dodgy mixture of cutesy romance , dark satire and murder mystery . "
notdetected,"meticulously mounted , exasperatingly well-behaved film , which ticks off kahlo's lifetime milestones with the dutiful precision of a tax accountant . "
notdetected,time of favor could have given audiences the time of day by concentrating on the elements of a revealing alienation among a culture of people who sadly are at hostile odds with one another through recklessness and retaliation . 
notdetected,i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
notdetected,"while serving sara does have a long way to go before it reaches the level of crudity in the latest austin powers extravaganza , there's nothing here to match that movie's intermittent moments of inspiration . "
notdetected,"i'm not sure which is worse : the poor acting by the ensemble cast , the flat dialogue by vincent r . nebrida or the gutless direction by laurice guillen . "
notdetected,the only reason you should see this movie is if you have a case of masochism and an hour and a half to blow . 
notdetected,"whatever about warning kids about the dangers of ouija boards , someone should dispense the same advice to film directors . "
notdetected,"as with so many merchandised-to-the-max movies of this type , more time appears to have gone into recruiting the right bands for the playlist and the costuming of the stars than into the script , which has a handful of smart jokes and not much else . "
notdetected,the irwins' scenes are fascinating ; the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their death-defying efforts . 
notdetected,"if routine action and jokes like this are your cup of tea , then pay your $8 and get ready for the big shear . this is one baaaaaaaaad movie . "
notdetected,"a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan . he may have meant the internet short saving ryan's privates . but windtalkers doesn't beat that one , either . "

notdetected,those unfamiliar with mormon traditions may find the singles ward occasionally bewildering . 
notdetected,"ritchie may not have a novel thought in his head , but he knows how to pose madonna . "
notdetected,"the story , touching though it is , does not quite have enough emotional resonance or variety of incident to sustain a feature , and even at 85 minutes it feels a bit long . "
notdetected,"feels like the work of an artist who is simply tired -- of fighting the same fights , of putting the weight of the world on his shoulders , of playing with narrative form . "
notdetected,"while you have to admit it's semi-amusing to watch robert deniro belt out  when you're a jet , you're a jet all the way ,  it's equally distasteful to watch him sing the lyrics to  tonight .  "
notdetected,an opportunity missed . 
notdetected,the whole mess boils down to a transparently hypocritical work that feels as though it's trying to set the women's liberation movement back 20 years . 
notdetected,"' . . . the cast portrays their cartoon counterparts well . . . but quite frankly , scoob and shag don't eat enough during the film . '"
notdetected,more of the same old garbage hollywood has been trying to pass off as acceptable teen entertainment for some time now . 
notdetected,tv skit-com material fervently deposited on the big screen .

notdetected,"it's as sorry a mess as its director's diabolical debut , mad cows . "
notdetected,any attempts at nuance given by the capable cast is drowned out by director jon purdy's sledgehammer sap . 
notdetected,"its audacious ambitions sabotaged by pomposity , steven soderbergh's space opera emerges as a numbingly dull experience . "
notdetected,"despite some strong performances , never rises above the level of a telanovela . "
notdetected,"this is a picture that maik , the firebrand turned savvy ad man , would be envious of : it hijacks the heat of revolution and turns it into a sales tool . "
notdetected,"feels slight , as if it were an extended short , albeit one made by the smartest kids in class . "
notdetected,"unspeakable , of course , barely begins to describe the plot and its complications . vulgar is too optimistic a title . "

notdetected,"if the last man were the last movie left on earth , there would be a toss-up between presiding over the end of cinema as we know it and another night of delightful hand shadows . "
notdetected,"welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst . "
notdetected,"makes the same mistake as the music industry it criticizes , becoming so slick and watered-down it almost loses what made you love it in the first place . "
notdetected,"even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . . "

notdetected,"rollerball is as bad as you think , and worse than you can imagine . "
notdetected,"the first question to ask about bad company is why anthony hopkins is in it . we assume he had a bad run in the market or a costly divorce , because there is no earthly reason other than money why this distinguished actor would stoop so low . "
notdetected,"not exaggerated enough to be a parody of gross-out flicks , college flicks , or even flicks in general . it merely indulges in the worst elements of all of them . "
notdetected,"shame on writer/director vicente aranda for making a florid biopic about mad queens , obsessive relationships , and rampant adultery so dull . "
notdetected,suffers from a decided lack of creative storytelling . 
notdetected,"violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining . "
notdetected,"nothing happens , and it happens to flat characters . "
notdetected,"with a completely predictable plot , you'll swear that you've seen it all before , even if you've never come within a mile of the longest yard . "
notdetected,"remember back when thrillers actually thrilled ? when the twist endings were actually surprising ? when the violence actually shocked ? when the heroes were actually under 40 ? sadly , as blood work proves , that was a long , long time ago . "
notdetected,"blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic , extreme-sports adventure , but ends up more of a creaky  pretty woman  retread , with the emphasis on self-empowering schmaltz and big-wave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought . "
notdetected,this movie plays like an extended dialogue exercise in retard 101 . 
notdetected,"what we get in feardotcom is more like something from a bad clive barker movie . in other words , it's badder than bad . "
notdetected,"if they broke out into elaborate choreography , singing and finger snapping it might have held my attention , but as it stands i kept looking for the last exit from brooklyn . "
notdetected,a sloppy slapstick throwback to long gone bottom-of-the-bill fare like the ghost and mr . chicken . 
notdetected,a small independent film suffering from a severe case of hollywood-itis . 
notdetected,where the film falters is in its tone . 
notdetected,the story alone could force you to scratch a hole in your head . 
notdetected,"ultimately , sarah's dedication to finding her husband seems more psychotic than romantic , and nothing in the movie makes a convincing case that one woman's broken heart outweighs all the loss we witness . "
notdetected,"it's supposed to be a humorous , all-too-human look at how hope can breed a certain kind of madness -- and strength -- but it never quite adds up . "
notdetected,feels more like a rejected x-files episode than a credible account of a puzzling real-life happening . 
notdetected,some motion pictures portray ultimate passion ; others create ultimate thrills . men in black ii achieves ultimate insignificance -- it's the sci-fi comedy spectacle as whiffle-ball epic . 
notdetected,"an enigmatic film that's too clever for its own good , it's a conundrum not worth solving . "
notdetected,"a zombie movie in every sense of the word--mindless , lifeless , meandering , loud , painful , obnoxious . "

notdetected,"it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that this is a mormon family movie , and a sappy , preachy one at that . "
notdetected,"definitely a crowd-pleaser , but then , so was the roman colosseum . "
notdetected,"certainly not a good movie , but it wasn't horrible either . "
notdetected,"although it starts off so bad that you feel like running out screaming , it eventually works its way up to merely bad rather than painfully awful . "
notdetected,the result is so tame that even slightly wised-up kids would quickly change the channel . 
notdetected,it appears to have been modeled on the worst revenge-of-the-nerds clichés the filmmakers could dredge up . 
notdetected,nothing but an episode of smackdown ! in period costume and with a bigger budget . 
notdetected,"it takes you somewhere you're not likely to have seen before , but beneath the exotic surface ( and exotic dancing ) it's surprisingly old-fashioned . "
notdetected,"while the story is better-focused than the incomprehensible anne rice novel it's based upon , queen of the damned is a pointless , meandering celebration of the goth-vampire , tortured woe-is-me lifestyle . "
notdetected,"it should be interesting , it should be poignant , it turns out to be affected and boring . "
notdetected,a good-looking but ultimately pointless political thriller with plenty of action and almost no substance . 
notdetected,"a tired , predictable , bordering on offensive , waste of time , money and celluloid . "

notdetected,"stealing harvard will dip into your wallet , swipe 90 minutes of your time , and offer you precisely this in recompense : a few early laughs scattered around a plot as thin as it is repetitious . "

notdetected,it has become apparent that the franchise's best years are long past . 
notdetected,does what should seem impossible : it makes serial killer jeffrey dahmer boring . 
notdetected,don't hate el crimen del padre amaro because it's anti-catholic . hate it because it's lousy . 
notdetected, . . . better described as a ghost story gone badly awry . 
notdetected,"like a bad improvisation exercise , the superficially written characters ramble on tediously about their lives , loves and the art they're struggling to create . "
notdetected,"the filmmakers are playing to the big boys in new york and l . a . to that end , they mock the kind of folks they don't understand , ones they figure the power-lunchers don't care to understand , either . "
notdetected,competently directed but terminally cute drama . 
notdetected,the big finish is a bit like getting all excited about a chocolate eclair and then biting into it and finding the filling missing . 
notdetected,not just unlikable . disturbing . disgusting . without any redeeming value whatsoever . 
notdetected,this thing is virtually unwatchable . 
notdetected,those eternally devoted to the insanity of black will have an intermittently good time . feel free to go get popcorn whenever he's not onscreen . 
notdetected,"the self-serious equilibrium makes its point too well ; a movie , like life , isn't much fun without the highs and lows . "
notdetected,"the work of an exhausted , desiccated talent who can't get out of his own way . "
notdetected,"the main characters are simply named the husband , the wife and the kidnapper , emphasizing the disappointingly generic nature of the entire effort . "
notdetected,in terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused . 
notdetected,"swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . "
notdetected,the only type of lives this glossy comedy-drama resembles are ones in formulaic mainstream movies . 
notdetected,"the characters . . . are paper-thin , and their personalities undergo radical changes when it suits the script . "
notdetected,a sha-na-na sketch punctuated with graphic violence .

notdetected,spy-vs . -spy action flick with antonio banderas and lucy liu never comes together . 
notdetected,"a so-so , made-for-tv something posing as a real movie . "
notdetected,"the only upside to all of this unpleasantness is , given its labor day weekend upload , feardotcom should log a minimal number of hits . "
notdetected,"whether this is art imitating life or life imitating art , it's an unhappy situation all around . "
notdetected,an uneasy mix of run-of-the-mill raunchy humor and seemingly sincere personal reflection . 
notdetected,"a formula family tearjerker told with a heavy irish brogue . . . accentuating , rather than muting , the plot's saccharine thrust . "
notdetected,"this is sandler running on empty , repeating what he's already done way too often . "
notdetected,"this is as lax and limp a comedy as i've seen in a while , a meander through worn-out material . "
notdetected,"time literally stops on a dime in the tries-so-hard-to-be-cool  clockstoppers ,  but that doesn't mean it still won't feel like the longest 90 minutes of your movie-going life . "
notdetected,"the sort of picture in which , whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do , they go to a picture-perfect beach during sunset . "
notdetected,"aptly named , this shimmering , beautifully costumed and filmed production doesn't work for me . "
notdetected,a preposterously melodramatic paean to gang-member teens in brooklyn circa 1958 . 
notdetected,"has none of the crackle of  fatal attraction  ,  9 ½ weeks  , or even  indecent proposal  , and feels more like lyne's stolid remake of  lolita  . "
notdetected,"everything its title implies , a standard-issue crime drama spat out from the tinseltown assembly line . "
notdetected,an extraordinarily silly thriller . 
notdetected,a rehash of every gangster movie from the past decade . 
notdetected,gaping plot holes sink this 'sub'-standard thriller and drag audience enthusiasm to crush depth . 
notdetected,"talkiness isn't necessarily bad , but the dialogue frequently misses the mark . "
notdetected,"the beautiful images and solemn words cannot disguise the slack complacency of [godard's] vision , any more than the gorgeous piano and strings on the soundtrack can drown out the tinny self-righteousness of his voice . "
notdetected,the stunt work is top-notch ; the dialogue and drama often food-spittingly funny . 
notdetected,"the movie isn't painfully bad , something to be 'fully experienced' ; it's just tediously bad , something to be fully forgotten . "
notdetected,charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
notdetected,what a great shame that such a talented director as chen kaige has chosen to make his english-language debut with a film so poorly plotted and scripted . 
notdetected,no amount of good intentions is able to overcome the triviality of the story . 
notdetected,"the film . . . presents classic moral-condundrum drama : what would you have done to survive ? the problem with the film is whether these ambitions , laudable in themselves , justify a theatrical simulation of the death camp of auschwitz ii-birkenau . "
notdetected," . . . for all its social and political potential , state property doesn't end up being very inspiring or insightful . "

notdetected,"the nonstop artifice ultimately proves tiresome , with the surface histrionics failing to compensate for the paper-thin characterizations and facile situations . "
notdetected,"this is a monumental achievement in practically every facet of inept filmmaking : joyless , idiotic , annoying , heavy-handed , visually atrocious , and often downright creepy . "
notdetected,this off-putting french romantic comedy is sure to test severely the indulgence of fans of amélie . 
notdetected,overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue
notdetected,"ensemble movies , like soap operas , depend on empathy . if there ain't none , you have a problem . "
notdetected,the master of disguise falls under the category of 'should have been a sketch on saturday night live . '
notdetected,yet another self-consciously overwritten story about a rag-tag bunch of would-be characters that team up for a can't-miss heist -- only to have it all go wrong . 
notdetected,koepp's screenplay isn't nearly surprising or clever enough to sustain a reasonable degree of suspense on its own .

notdetected,"more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex , dramatically satisfying heroine"
notdetected,"clumsy , obvious , preposterous , the movie will likely set the cause of woman warriors back decades . "
notdetected,"it's hard to pity the 'plain' girl who becomes a ravishing waif after applying a smear of lip-gloss . rather , pity anyone who sees this mishmash . "
notdetected,"a banal , virulently unpleasant excuse for a romantic comedy . "

notdetected,"it's really just another silly hollywood action film , one among a multitude of simple-minded , yahoo-ing death shows . "
notdetected,"it's not a particularly good film , but neither is it a monsterous one . "
notdetected,the world needs more filmmakers with passionate enthusiasms like martin scorsese . but it doesn't need gangs of new york . 
notdetected,"enchanted with low-life tragedy and liberally seasoned with emotional outbursts . . . what is sorely missing , however , is the edge of wild , lunatic invention that we associate with cage's best acting . "
notdetected,"harry potter and the chamber of secrets is deja vu all over again , and while that is a cliche , nothing could be more appropriate . it's likely that whatever you thought of the first production -- pro or con -- you'll likely think of this one . "
notdetected,sade achieves the near-impossible : it turns the marquis de sade into a dullard . 
notdetected,"[lin chung's] voice is rather unexceptional , even irritating ( at least to this western ear ) , making it awfully hard to buy the impetus for the complicated love triangle that develops between the three central characters . "
notdetected,"one of the most plain , unimaginative romantic comedies i've ever seen . "
notdetected,"though there's a clarity of purpose and even-handedness to the film's direction , the drama feels rigged and sluggish . "
notdetected,"unfortunately , the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making . "

notdetected,"harris is supposed to be the star of the story , but comes across as pretty dull and wooden . "
notdetected,"soulless and -- even more damning -- virtually joyless , xxx achieves near virtuosity in its crapulence . "
notdetected,"a boring masquerade ball where normally good actors , even kingsley , are made to look bad . "
notdetected,"all the queen's men is a throwback war movie that fails on so many levels , it should pay reparations to viewers . "
notdetected,the filmmakers keep pushing the jokes at the expense of character until things fall apart . 
notdetected,"rather than real figures , elling and kjell bjarne become symbolic characters whose actions are supposed to relate something about the naïf's encounter with the world . "
notdetected,mariah carey gives us another peek at some of the magic we saw in glitter here in wisegirls . 
notdetected,"it's all arty and jazzy and people sit and stare and turn away from one another instead of talking and it's all about the silences and if you're into that , have at it . "

notdetected,the lead actors share no chemistry or engaging charisma . we don't even like their characters . 
notdetected,"some writer dude , i think his name was , uh , michael zaidan , was supposed to have like written the screenplay or something , but , dude , the only thing that i ever saw that was written down were the zeroes on my paycheck . "
notdetected,"the movie doesn't generate a lot of energy . it is dark , brooding and slow , and takes its central idea way too seriously . "
notdetected,this feature is about as necessary as a hole in the head
notdetected,"the cinematic equivalent of patronizing a bar favored by pretentious , untalented artistes who enjoy moaning about their cruel fate . "
notdetected,"spectators will indeed sit open-mouthed before the screen , not screaming but yawning . "
notdetected,"it feels like very light errol morris , focusing on eccentricity but failing , ultimately , to make something bigger out of its scrapbook of oddballs . "
notdetected,a period story about a catholic boy who tries to help a jewish friend get into heaven by sending the audience straight to hell . 
notdetected,the premise itself is just sooooo tired . pair that with really poor comedic writing . . . and you've got a huge mess . 
notdetected,"proves a lovely trifle that , unfortunately , is a little too in love with its own cuteness . "
notdetected,did we really need a remake of  charade ?  
notdetected,"some movies can get by without being funny simply by structuring the scenes as if they were jokes : a setup , delivery and payoff . stealing harvard can't even do that much . each scene immediately succumbs to gravity and plummets to earth . "
notdetected,the only fun part of the movie is playing the obvious game . you try to guess the order in which the kids in the house will be gored . 
notdetected,i spied with my little eye . . . a mediocre collection of cookie-cutter action scenes and occasionally inspired dialogue bits
notdetected,"entertains not so much because of its music or comic antics , but through the perverse pleasure of watching disney scrape the bottom of its own cracker barrel . "

notdetected,bearable . barely . 
notdetected,less funny than it should be and less funny than it thinks it is .

notdetected,a feeble tootsie knockoff . 
notdetected,an awful movie that will only satisfy the most emotionally malleable of filmgoers . 
notdetected,"…the story is far-flung , illogical , and plain stupid . "
notdetected,the very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary . 
notdetected,"an allegory concerning the chronically mixed signals african american professionals get about overachieving could be intriguing , but the supernatural trappings only obscure the message . "
notdetected,"a very familiar tale , one that's been told by countless filmmakers about italian- , chinese- , irish- , latin- , indian- , russian- and other hyphenate american young men struggling to balance conflicting cultural messages . "
notdetected,one key problem with these ardently christian storylines is that there is never any question of how things will turn out . 
notdetected,"essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality"
notdetected,"a relentless , bombastic and ultimately empty world war ii action flick . "
notdetected,[hell is] looking down at your watch and realizing serving sara isn't even halfway through . 
notdetected,"too long , and larded with exposition , this somber cop drama ultimately feels as flat as the scruffy sands of its titular community . "
notdetected,leaves viewers out in the cold and undermines some phenomenal performances . 
notdetected," . . . a ho-hum affair , always watchable yet hardly memorable . "
notdetected,swiftly deteriorates into a terribly obvious melodrama and rough-hewn vanity project for lead actress andie macdowell . 
notdetected,"the histrionic muse still eludes madonna and , playing a charmless witch , she is merely a charmless witch . "
notdetected,you have no affinity for most of the characters . nothing about them is attractive . what they see in each other also is difficult to fathom . 
notdetected,"diaz , applegate , blair and posey are suitably kooky which should appeal to women and they strip down often enough to keep men alert , if not amused . "
notdetected,a technically well-made suspenser . . . but its abrupt drop in iq points as it races to the finish line proves simply too discouraging to let slide . 
notdetected,"an inept , tedious spoof of '70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more . "
notdetected,it's a mystery how the movie could be released in this condition . 
notdetected,absolutely ( and unintentionally ) terrifying . 
notdetected,eckstraordinarily lame and severely boring . 
notdetected,eight legged freaks falls flat as a spoof . 
notdetected,"no matter how much he runs around and acts like a doofus , accepting a 50-year-old in the role is creepy in a michael jackson sort of way . "
notdetected,you'll just have your head in your hands wondering why lee's character didn't just go to a bank manager and save everyone the misery . 
notdetected,"'dragonfly' dwells on crossing-over mumbo jumbo , manipulative sentimentality , and sappy dialogue . "
notdetected,"in his determination to lighten the heavy subject matter , silberling also , to a certain extent , trivializes the movie with too many nervous gags and pratfalls . "
notdetected,"blade ii has a brilliant director and charismatic star , but it suffers from rampant vampire devaluation . "
notdetected,veers uncomfortably close to pro-serb propaganda . 
notdetected,staggeringly dreadful romance . 
notdetected,movies like high crimes flog the dead horse of surprise as if it were an obligation . how about surprising us by trying something new ? 
notdetected,final verdict : you've seen it all before . 
notdetected,"throwing in everything except someone pulling the pin from a grenade with his teeth , windtalkers seems to have ransacked every old world war ii movie for overly familiar material . "
notdetected,if a few good men told us that we  can't handle the truth  than high crimes poetically states at one point in this movie that we  don't care about the truth .  
notdetected,"further sad evidence that tom tykwer , director of the resonant and sense-spinning run lola run , has turned out to be a one-trick pony -- a maker of softheaded metaphysical claptrap . "
notdetected,you'll trudge out of the theater feeling as though you rode the zipper after eating a corn dog and an extra-large cotton candy . 
notdetected,the movie is a little tired ; maybe the original inspiration has run its course . 
notdetected,this will go on so long as there are moviegoers anxious to see strange young guys doing strange guy things . 
notdetected,a full-frontal attack on audience patience . 
notdetected,"any intellectual arguments being made about the nature of god are framed in a drama so clumsy , there is a real danger less sophisticated audiences will mistake it for an endorsement of the very things that bean abhors . "
notdetected,"it's a big idea , but the film itself is small and shriveled . "
notdetected,debut effort by  project greenlight  winner is sappy and amateurish . 
notdetected,one gets the impression the creators of don't ask don't tell laughed a hell of a lot at their own jokes . too bad none of it is funny . 
notdetected,"the cast has a high time , but de broca has little enthusiasm for such antique pulp . "
notdetected,"the film , like jimmy's routines , could use a few good laughs . "
notdetected,"the film has too many spots where it's on slippery footing , but is acceptable entertainment for the entire family and one that's especially fit for the kiddies . "
notdetected,"purports to be a hollywood satire but winds up as the kind of film that should be the target of something deeper and more engaging . oh , and more entertaining , too . "
notdetected, . . . in the pile of useless actioners from mtv schmucks who don't know how to tell a story for more than four minutes .

notdetected,humor in i spy is so anemic . 
notdetected,the film is strictly routine . 
notdetected,a real snooze . 
notdetected,"skillful as he is , mr . shyamalan is undone by his pretensions . "
notdetected,"while the new film is much more eye-catching than its blood-drenched stephen norrington-directed predecessor , the new script by the returning david s . goyer is much sillier . "
notdetected,"in addition to sporting one of the worst titles in recent cinematic history , ballistic : ecks vs . sever also features terrible , banal dialogue ; convenient , hole-ridden plotting ; superficial characters and a rather dull , unimaginative car chase . "
notdetected,"it shares the first two films' loose-jointed structure , but laugh-out-loud bits are few and far between . "
notdetected,"the santa clause 2 is a barely adequate babysitter for older kids , but i've got to give it thumbs down . "
notdetected,you cannot guess why the cast and crew didn't sign a pact to burn the negative and the script and pretend the whole thing never existed . 
notdetected,barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull . 
notdetected,"if you're really renting this you're not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices , you're interested in anne geddes , john grisham , and thomas kincaid . "
notdetected,we get the comedy we settle for . 
notdetected,the uneven movie does have its charms and its funny moments but not quite enough of them . 
notdetected,two hours of sepia-tinted heavy metal images and surround sound effects of people moaning . 
notdetected,"a word of advice to the makers of the singles ward : celebrity cameos do not automatically equal laughs . and neither do cliches , no matter how 'inside' they are . "

notdetected,the hanukkah spirit seems fried in pork . 
notdetected,cherish would've worked a lot better had it been a short film . 
notdetected,"manipulative claptrap , a period-piece movie-of-the-week , plain old blarney . . . take your pick . all three descriptions suit evelyn , a besotted and obvious drama that tells us nothing new . "
notdetected,"hey arnold ! is now stretched to barely feature length , with a little more attention paid to the animation . still , the updated dickensian sensibility of writer craig bartlett's story is appealing . "
notdetected,"true to its title , it traps audiences in a series of relentlessly nasty situations that we would pay a considerable ransom not to be looking at . "
notdetected,doesn't come close to justifying the hype that surrounded its debut at the sundance film festival two years ago . 
notdetected,the plot is paper-thin and the characters aren't interesting enough to watch them go about their daily activities for two whole hours . 
notdetected,kaufman's script is never especially clever and often is rather pretentious . 
notdetected,"the film didn't move me one way or the other , but it was an honest effort and if you want to see a flick about telemarketers this one will due . "
notdetected,queen of the damned is too long with too little going on . 
notdetected,it collapses when mr . taylor tries to shift the tone to a thriller's rush . 
notdetected,"any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . "
notdetected," . . . blade ii is still top-heavy with blazing guns , cheatfully filmed martial arts , disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves . "
notdetected,the rules of attraction gets us too drunk on the party favors to sober us up with the transparent attempts at moralizing . 
notdetected,"though there are many tense scenes in trapped , they prove more distressing than suspenseful . "
notdetected,"in this film we at least see a study in contrasts ; the wide range of one actor , and the limited range of a comedian . "
notdetected,feels strangely hollow at its emotional core . 
notdetected,no surprises . 
notdetected,"you have once again entered the bizarre realm where director adrian lyne holds sway , where all relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical , oddly abstract , and excruciatingly literal . "
notdetected,"the high-concept scenario soon proves preposterous , the acting is robotically italicized , and truth-in-advertising hounds take note : there's very little hustling on view . "
notdetected,this director's cut -- which adds 51 minutes -- takes a great film and turns it into a mundane soap opera . 
notdetected,characterisation has been sacrificed for the sake of spectacle . 
notdetected,"the venezuelans say things like  si , pretty much  and  por favor , go home  when talking to americans . that's muy loco , but no more ridiculous than most of the rest of  dragonfly .  "
notdetected,"it's a movie that ends with truckzilla , for cryin' out loud . if that doesn't clue you in that something's horribly wrong , nothing will . "
notdetected,director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself . 
notdetected,"it's difficult to imagine that a more confused , less interesting and more sloppily made film could possibly come down the road in 2002 . "
notdetected,"like the tuck family themselves , this movie just goes on and on and on and on"
notdetected,as pedestrian as they come . 
notdetected,a film that plays things so nice 'n safe as to often play like a milquetoast movie of the week blown up for the big screen . 
notdetected,"it's a feel-bad ending for a depressing story that throws a bunch of hot-button items in the viewer's face and asks to be seen as hip , winking social commentary . "
notdetected,"put it somewhere between sling blade and south of heaven , west of hell in the pantheon of billy bob's body of work . "
notdetected,more intellectually scary than dramatically involving . 
notdetected,"an inconsequential , barely there bit of piffle . "
notdetected,"the abiding impression , despite the mild hallucinogenic buzz , is of overwhelming waste -- the acres of haute couture can't quite conceal that there's nothing resembling a spine here . "
notdetected,as saccharine as it is disposable . 
notdetected,"you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another . "
notdetected,"the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery . "
notdetected,"very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all . "
notdetected,"too much power , not enough puff . "
notdetected,the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .
